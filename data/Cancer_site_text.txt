Overview of Cancer
What IS Cancer?

What most people think of when we say cancer is something like the 3 examples above.
Top Left: Head and neck cancer located on the lower side of the tongue.
Bottom Left: squamous cell carcinoma (L) on a man's ear, and a biopsy (R) from a cutaneous melanoma.
Bottom right: Advanced lung cancers.

All 3 are good examples of cancer, but when do we call it cancer? Look at these photos:

There is a large squamous carcinoma (bottom of picture) that has obliterated the cervix and invaded the lower uterine segment. The uterus also has a round leiomyoma up higher. The leiomyoma is an incidental tumor, and benign.  This degree of cancer has probably spread widely and will be fatal.

Now compare this to another image of the cervix below:

"Ca in situ, cervix 2" by Haymanj - photomicrograph by author.. Licensed under Public domain via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ca_in_situ,_cervix_2.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Ca_in_situ,_cervix_2.jpg

The micrograph shows high grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ) in the uterine cervix. Cervical cancer is often predated by cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL, previously CIN, a form of dysplasia). The term carcinoma in situ may be used interchangeably with high grade SIL (HSIL).  The abnormal epithelium is extending into a mucus gland to the left of center.

The point of this comparison is that the disease COULD progress to invasive cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) of the cervix similar what is shown in the previous panel. However, abnormal cells at this stage can be removed easily, and will not return after treatment.

Some questions to think about this semester:

If it is easily treated and does not return, should we be calling it cancer?
Where is the line separating cancer and pre-cancer?


Who Gets Cancer? Who Doesn’t? What is the Impact?
In the United States, cancer is poised to become the main cause of death overall. So who is most likely to develop it?

Overall, the total US incidence is estimated at 1.69 million new diagnoses annually, and 595,690 deaths. However, those deaths are NOT distributed equally over all age groups. The graph below shows the incidence, meaning, the average number of people (out of 100,000)  in the U.S. annually who will get cancer on the Y axis, versus age on the X-axis. From this we see cancer is FAR more common as we get older.
Which types are we most likely to develop? Most likely to die from?
The graphs below show incidence and mortality rates for the most common forms of cancer in the US, by gender.

Based on data obtained from NCI SEER data http://seer.cancer.gov/ covering 1975-2013. NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries that cover approximately 28 percent of the U.S. population.


From these data, we can surmise that some types of cancer are very "survivable," while other categories have a poor prognosis. Whether or not patients survive their cancer depends on the type, stage at which it is detected, and how it progresses. In short, cancer is not one single disease, but a FAMILY of diseases.
What is the Economic Impact?
According to recent data from the National Cancer Institute, total estimated cost to care for cancer patients will be $143.6 billion annually in 2016 (http://progressreport.cancer.gov/doc_detail.asp?pid=1&did=2011&chid=105&coid=1026&mid=).
Why Does Cancer Scare Us?
If we look at the overall survival rates, cancer is NOT the worst diagnosis an individual can receive. If we compare 5-year survival rates, several common diseases have a poorer prognosis.




While cancer is NOT the disease with the lowest 5-year survival rate, other factors feed our fear of it. They include (but are not limited to):

Cost. Treating cancer is more expensive than heart disease.
Rapidity. Heart disease (#1 cause of death in US) often kills suddenly. Cancer is slowly progressive. Family must watch a loved one slowly waste away.
Complexity. Heart disease can be simplified into a problem of plumbing; the pipes are clogged. Cancer is more difficult to explain to lay persons, and so more mysterious.
Causality. Heart disease can be traced to a few clear factors: diet, hypertension, familial history, lifestyle. The origins of cancer cannot be defined so easily. It is a complex disease with a large cast of molecular players.
It appears to be unavoidable.  It is a common fallacy that "everything causes cancer." This is true in that the basic processes of life are what lead to cancer. However, some behaviors (smoking for example) DO dramatically raise cancer risk. These are the avoidable risk factors for cancer.

Why Should We Study Biology of Cancer?
Understanding how it starts and why it progresses:

Helps us predict behavior and progression. There are ~200 types of cancer known, and it is estimated that each of these types can be sub-divided based on underlying mutations. Knowing how a particular cancer type is likely to behave is the first step in effective treatment. 
Helps us diagnose which sub-type of cancer individuals have, and tailor treatment. Initially, two patients may seem to have the same cancer. While the disease might appear similar, the cancer cells will respond very differently to particular treatments depending on the driver mutations.
Improves the prognosis. Generally, the earlier cancer is detected, the more likely a patient can be treated effectively.
Reveals basic biology of normal cells. Much of what we know about normal cell function has come from labs and researchers working to understand how normal functions have failed in cancer cells.


B2. Early Observations
Cancer Predates Humans & Recorded History
Sources: http://louisvillefossils.blogspot.com/2012/01/fossilized-cancer-tumor.html
http://kfor.com/2016/07/28/scientists-find-cancer-in-million-year-old-fossil/
http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/oldest-human-cancer-disease-origins-tumor-fossil-science/

Cancer is not a condition unique to humans. It occurs in all vertebrate animal clades. As the image above shows, sarcomas have been identified in fossilized dinosaur bones that predate humans by tens of millions of years.

We know this from human fossils that cancer has been part of human biology from the origins of our species. Look at the above right image. This bone from a 1.7-2 million year old hominoid ancestor clearly has a bony outgrowth much like the osteosarcomas that modern humans develop. Anatomically modern human mummies from ancient Egypt and Peru have tumors and disseminated cancers too.
There Are Distinct Periods of Interest In Cancer
Earliest Historical Observations
Physicians have been interested in cancer from the start of recorded medical history. The first documented description of cancer comes from the Edwin Smith Papyrus (dated ~3000 BC.) It is an ancient Egyptian text on trauma surgery that describes 8 different breast tumors, 4 of which apparently had progressed to the point of ulcerating the overlying skin. The writer describes removing them by “hot cauterization,” but otherwise states “there is no treatment.”

Greek physicians also knew about cancer. Hippocrates (460-370 BC) called non-ulcer forming, ulcer-forming tumors carcinos, (root for our word carcinoma), which is the Greek word  for “crab.”  Hippocrates used carcinos to refer to finger-like invasive projections from a central mass.

Up until the 18th century, various causes for cancer were proposed. The humoral theory of imbalance in body humors was a commonly cited cause well into the 1500s. Other possible causes included a punishment from various gods, contagion (meaning it spread from person to person by unknown means), and slow poisoning.

Lack of a clear cause did not keep surgeons from treating cancers. The engraving below shows two views of a Dutch woman who had a tumor removed from her neck in 1689. The reverse side of the print describes the tumor and its removal in detail.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death. The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius, a follower of Descartes, believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was contagious.

Period of First Ad Hoc Discoveries
The 1700s were the age of the Enlightenment, when scientists and physicians started to abandon Greek ideals of logical thought and argument and embrace rigorous observation and experimentation as the best path to solving problems relating to natural phenomena. Several discoveries in the 1700s and 1800s created the foundation for modern research.

1761: John Hill links chronic use of tobacco snuff with nasal cancer
1775: Percival Pott links soot to scrotal cancer in young boys and men working as chimney sweeps
1800: Czech physicians identify a "cancer cluster" when they find higher rates of lung cancer among silver miners.
1839: it is discovered that the incidence of breast cancer is higher in nunneries (but no proximal cause is identified.)
1876: researchers learn that tumors can be transplanted b/t dogs, rats, mice, and in some cases, between the species.

These types of systematic observations set the stage for the first controlled experimental studies of cancer, which started in the 1880s and became more common in the 1890s.

B3. 1890 to 1950s
The Macro View Era For Cancer Biology  
The first systematic investigations of the processes leading to cancer began in the 1890s. Initial work focused on:

Identifying causal agents
Finding appropriate animal models
Mapping progression and staging of cancer. This is when our modern system of staging cancer on a I to IV scale began.
The first controlled studies of the epidemiology of cancer started in the 1940s, followed shortly by collection and reporting of incidence and other statistics on the general population.

This also is the time when 3 major treatment strategies emerged:

Surgery had been practiced for >5000, but began to be  refined with the introduction of anesthesia, better surgical methods, and aseptic techniques.
The first clinical use of radiation therapies began ~1900, shortly after high energy X-rays and radio-isotopes were discovered.
The first chemotherapy treatments were developed in the early 1940s.

In 1905, there were 3 competing hypotheses as to what caused cancer
Hypothesis A: Cancer is due to environmental toxins
Katsusaburo Yamagiwa was a Japanese research scientist interested in carcinogenesis. His coal tar experiments were a major piece of evidence to support this as the main cause of cancer.

Briefly, coal tar is a thick, molasses-like substance extracted from coal by heating it without letting it ignite. It is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds. It had been known for some time that there were higher than normal rates of carcinoma among coal tar distillery workers.

Yamagiwa's work was based on a commonly held theory of the time: the "irritation theory of carcinogenesis." The introduction to one of his seminal article describes the principle this way:
"...The repetition or continuation of chronic irritation may cause a precancerous alteration in epithelium previously normal. If the irritant continue its action, carcinoma may be the outcome, even though no specific agent has been interpolated.
For our experiments, we have employed mainly the ear of the domestic rabbit, an organ in which no spontaneous new growth has ever been reported. Among the methods of mechanical or chemical irritation chosen, the painting of coal-tar upon the inner surface of the ear has been the most efficacious in producing carcinoma..."

Like others at the time, Yamagiwa found that painting the inner ear of a rabbit with coal tar every 2-3 days produced abnormal thickening of the skin. Only when he continued application for >100 days did the thickened epithelium change to an overt carcinoma.

Subsequent studies separated components of coal tar, and identified many potent carcinogens. Each of the 8 molecules shown in the figure below have been identified in coal tar AND shown to be mutagens. One is particularly important: benzo-a-pyrene, which also is the chief mutagen and carcinogenic agent in cigarette smoke.




Hypothesis B: Cancer is a contagious disease
About the time Yamagiwa was working on coal tar mutagens, a young researcher in New York named Peyton Rous (below) was visited by a local farmer with a chicken. His prize breeder had a large tumor in its skeletal muscle. 


Rous extracted a sample, and was able to establish a stable tumor in every chicken where a piece was injected. Rous tried to identify the causal agent using a recently discovered ceramic filtration method. Tumor tissue was ground finely  then filtered through the ceramic filter, which had pores much smaller than the smallest bacteria. 

Rous' filtrate still could initiate tumors when injected into new chickens, which indicated that either the tumor filtrate contained an extremely powerful carcinogenic compound, or it contained a virus. Later work confirmed that the sarcomas contained a virus, subsequently named the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV). Rous' virus was the first clear evidence that cancer might be due to infectious agents.

While Rous was studying chickens, Dr. Johannes Fibiger of Denmark (below, left) was studying a different model of cancer. A student of the great microbiologist Robert Koch (of Koch's postulates fame), Fibiger published studies in 1913 describing how common rats developed gastric tumors when infected with spirochetes. His findings were considered hard evidence that cancer was caused by pathogenic organisms, and netted Fibiger the Nobel Prize in 1926.

Fibiger's story is unfortunate for 3 reasons.

His work was soon discredited. By 1937, it had been shown that what he called gastric tumors was actually focal inflammation, triggered by a combination of the rats' poor diet and vitamin A deficiency. Yes, spirochete infection was involved, but only as a non-specific irritant. ANY foreign organism would have triggered the growths he saw. It is considered the biggest mistake in Nobel Prize history.
Yamagiwa was nominated 7 times for the Nobel, including the year of Fibiger's prize, but never received it, even though his work was more meticulous.
Fibiger's error essentially shut down research on infectious agents in cancer for nearly 50 years. It was 1985 before Dr. Barry Marshall (below, right) showed conclusively that the bacterium Helicobacter pylori is the main cause of stomach ulcers.



Johnanes Fibiger (left) and  Barry Marshall (right)

Tidbit: After receiving the Nobel Prize in 2005 for his discovery, Marshall went on to show that H. pylori ALSO is a key inflammatory driver of neoplastic transformation in stomach cancer. Marshall showed that stomach ulcers could be cured, and many stomach cancers forced into remission, with a single course of common antibiotics. In doing so, Marshall toppled the most profitable class of prescribed drugs at the time, eliminating several billion dollars in annual revenue for the pharmaceutical industry.
Hypothesis C: Cancer is familial/social
Today we know that some individuals have inherited a genome that predisposes them to certain cancers. However, when this hypothesis was first put forward, it was largely ignored. Why?

The observations certainly were in place. It was well known by the first half of the 20th century that some families have rates of specific cancers that are much higher than expected. What the medical and scientific community lacked was a model for explaining inherited susceptibility. Remember, Mendel's papers on inheritance were not discovered by the scientific community until after 1900. Watson and Crick did not publish their description of the structure of DNA until 1953.

This is a very good example of a hypothesis that cannot be tested, so must be ignored.
The First Chemotherapies 
World War 1-era soldier in field hospital after exposure to mustard gas. Large blisters have formed on on his wrist and neck, and smaller blisters on his face.

During World War I both Allied Forces and Central Powers used a variety of chemical weapons on the battlefield, including several mustard gas compounds that acted as "blister agents. " Meant to incapacitate troops, victims later developed crippling or fatal anemia. Autopsies showed that mustard agents reduced or destroyed bone marrow.

Drs. Goodman and Gilman discovered the clinical value of sulfur mustards in 1940s, in part because of a military disaster. On December 2, 1942, the US naval destroyer SS John Harvey (carrying 130,000 lbs of sulfur mustard) was bombed in an air raid at Bari, Italy. Thousands of people in the port city were exposed, and many died from anemia, myeloid failure, and lymphoid suppression. 

In early 1943 the two US physicians proposed using the bone marrow suppressing effects of sulfur mustards to treat various cancers originating in bone marrow. When sulfur mustards proved too toxic, Goodman and Gilman synthesized a modified version with nitrogen instead of sulfur as the central atom - hence the name nitrogen mustard. They subsequently used it to treat lymphoma successfully.

In 1947-1948, Dr. Sidney Farber began using a folic acid antagonist called methotrexate to treat pediatric patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Folate is essential for DNA synthesis; methotrexate kills actively dividing cells by preventing this. By carefully adjusting the dose, Farber could kill more leukemia cells than normal body cells, and eventually reduce the concentration of leukemia cells in blood to nearly undetectable levels.

Other chemotherapies soon followed. Most were based on one of two principles:

Use genotoxic chemicals to fatally damage the most actively dividing cells (Goodman and Gilman's strategy)
Starve tumor cells of essential metabolites (Farber's approach)

Staging Cancer's Progression 
The first half of the 20th century also was the time when clinicians began mapping how specific cancers progressed. Ultimately most settled on a 4-stage classification system that we still use today. In general, the chances for survival and recovery drop as a patient's cancer progresses from Stage I to Stage IV. Characteristic features have been defined for each of the stages for each type of cancer.


Top Left: Cross section of normal human skin showing the melanocytes (dark brown) transporting melanin granules vertically to upper keratinocyte layers. This is Stage 0 (normal).  Top Right: a single well-defined melanoma (black) surrounded by normal skin (pale tan). A tumor at this stage (Stage II) probably has not spread beyond the original site. Bottom: metastases of melanoma erupting on the surface of a man's chest. Rapidly spreading, numerous metastases are typical in Stage IV cancer.
Animal Models Gain Ground 
The time from 1900 to 1950 also was the first time scientists began conducting controlled experiments with animal models, rather than relying on observations of human disease. The experiments of Yamagiwa and Rous and just two of innumerable examples. Animal models also gave scientists their first glimpses into the processes by which tumors spread to new sites.

B4. 1950s to 90s
The Cellular Era of Cancer Biology
At this point in time, new tools were becoming available for research that shifted scientists' interests away from the gross level towards a micro-level perspective. Eukaryotic cell culture started out as a tool to support virology research in the 1940s and 1950s, but from the early 1950s onward, biologists began using cells in culture as a model in their own right. Some classic cell lines we still use today (HeLa being the most famous) were established in the 1950s to 1970s.

Some virologists continued exploring how the Rous sarcoma virus stimulated proliferation. Howard Temin determined that normal eukaryotic cells infected with RSV developed abnormal growth patterns (shown below).

Temin's transformed cells. Top row: growth pattern of normal (left) and RSV-infected cells (right). Photos taken with phase contrast microscopy.  Lower row: scanning electron micrographs show normal cells (left) tend to form a smooth monolayer, while RSV-infected cells (right) form disordered aggregates that may be several layers deep.


Temin also discovered that RSV-infected cells displayed some interesting cellular behaviors, regardless of the animal or tissue cells were obtained from. Dulbecco, Temin, and Baltimore won the Nobel in 1975 for their work on oncoviruses, more specifically, their discovery of the reverse transcriptase enzyme that let RNA viruses integrate into cells' DNA. While their discovery was important, more people remember Temin as the first to describe the shared properties of transformed cells (summarized in table below).


Given these shared traits, Temin proposed a model of cancer development based on monoclonality. Simply put, most cells in a tumor are daughters of a single mutated cell (that is one clone). Mutations  arise once, then after that all daughter cells will have them. Once a cell gains the appropriate set of mutations, it quickly grows to a monoclonal mass of cells that all have the same genotype.



The monoclonal theory solved several problems of neoplastic transformation, and early evidence suggested it was true. However, more advanced sequencing methods have shown us that there is considerable variation in the number and types of mutations present in each tumor.

Current evidence says that a tumor does have monoclonal areas, and one genotype does predominate in the mass, but cells with different genotypes are present at every stage. The cells in a  tumor face aggressive selection for maximum survival advantage. Cells with the most advantageous (for the tumor) mutations will proliferate and become the majority of the population. As a cancer progresses and conditions change over time, cells with one suite of mutations can be replaced by cells with a different mutation. In short, tumor masses undergo a process of evolution through selection.
Viruses Play a Minor Role in Human Cancers
In non-human animals, dozens of viruses were discovered that triggered cancer development. Some examples:


Non-human animal tumorigenic viruses were identified for mice, rats, cats, birds, and even apes. To date though, less than 10  viruses have ever been conclusively linked to human cancers. Known oncoviruses in humans are:

Epstein Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, but in central Africa also can cause Burkitt's lymphoma
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), linked to hepatic carcinoma
The Herpesviruses, which includes:
Shope’s HPV (the cause of warts),
Human papillomaviruses HPV-16, -18, linked to cervical cancer
Kaposi's sarcoma-related herpesvirus, or KSHV
HTLV-I, a cousin of the HTLV-III/HIV virus, causes T-cell leukemia

Left: SV40-infected non-human animals cells. Prior to lysis, vacuoles filled with viral particles crowd the cytoplasm. Right: red lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma. Prior to the emergence of HIV, KS was rare outside elderly men of certain Mediterranean ethnic groups. Once the HIV virus decimates the immune system, patients co-infected with KSHV cannot prevent the replication of the second virus. (Sources: left-Weinberg, 2e; right-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposi's_sarcoma-associated_herpesvirus)

Oncogenes:  The Next Step
By the mid-1970s it was becoming clear that loss of control of NORMAL cellular processes were responsible for the ABNORMAL cells of cancer.  But, what causes it?

In 1976 (a year after Temin's Nobel), Harold Varmus and James Bishop published their work on Peyton Rous' RSV virus. Varmus and Bishop provided the first evidence that the genetic code for viral oncogenes are mutant versions of normal, non-mutant oncogenes found in nearly all eukaryotic cells. Later, Varmus and Bishop also would win the Nobel for this work.

(Go to the page H1. Self Sufficient Growth to learn more about oncogenes.)
Surveillance Statistics Start Paying Off
Advances in surveillance and epidemiology in the 1940s and 1950  also began to pay off about this time.

During World War II, most GIs were encouraged to smoke to calm their nerves. Cigarettes were part of the standard food rations. 15-20 years later, surveillance data showed a rapid spike in lung cancer incidence. On January 11, 1964, Rear Admiral Luther Leonidas Terry, M.D., Surgeon General, published a landmark report saying that smoking may be hazardous to health, sparking nationwide anti-smoking efforts.

This first "Surgeon General's Report" was the first of many connections that would be made on the basis of epidemiological surveillance data.
Chemotherapy Remains A Brute Force War of Attrition
The first chemotherapy drugs were extremely toxic. Nitrogen mustards were derivatives of chemical warfare agents, and anti-metabolites like methotrexate were as likely to kill the patient as the tumor. Sidney Farber and others engaged in a lengthy battle of wills about the ethics of subjecting patients (mainly children) to strong chemotherapy.

At the same time, both the government and private companies were actively pursuing new chemotherapies.
The 1950s:
Burroughs Wellcome Co., UK, introduced 6-mercaptopurine, an analog to a DNA nucleotide that acted as a potent anti-metabolite. During the same decade, Eli Lilly & Co introduced vincristine and vinblastine for leukemia. Both drugs block microtubule polymerization, and in doing so kill actively dividing cell. They were originally purified from tropical periwinkle.

In 1955, the National Cancer Institute opens the Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center, a specialized facility for testing chemotherapies. NCI also creates a national repository of chemical compounds that were developed for testing. Few compounds synthesized and tested proved effective on their targeted cancer; NCI hoped that some compounds would prove useful on a different type of cancer later. Several compounds did prove useful in subsequent testing, but one case stands out.

In the 1980s, Burroughs Wellcome Co. began screening NCI's chemical library for compounds that could block retroviral replication. Their screen identified several candidates, including a failed chemotherapy drug called 3-azidothymidine, or AZT. The drug proved extremely effective in treating HIV, and was approved for sale by the FDA in just 18 months (one of the shortest "submission to approval" times ever.)

AZT is now just one of several compounds from the NCI library that are used to treat HIV. Thanks to the NCI, HIV is a manageable chronic disease, not a death sentence.
The 1960s:
When Goodman, Gilman, and Farber first started using chemotherapeutic drugs, patients received only one drug at a time. In the 1960s, several groups began experimenting with alternative strategies. Several important clinical strategies arose during this time, all of which are still standard practice.

1. Combo therapies
Combo therapies are just what they sound like. Patients receive multiple chemotherapeutic drugs simultaneously. One example of a regimen developed during this era for adult leukemia was called POMP. It consisted of 4 drugs:
P=6-mercaptopurine (Purinethol; DNA synthesis blocker)
O=vincristine (Oncovin; microtubule assembly blocker)
M=methotrexate (anti-folate)
P=prednisone (general immuno-suppression)

Combo therapies operate under the assumption that tumor cells cannot develop resistance to multiple drugs that target different pathways or processes at the same time. This would be true under the monoclonality model. However there are many examples of patients with tumors that regress initially, then return with resistance to all drugs in the treatment regimen. This level of adaptation is probably due to selection for a very small subset of cells in the tumor that would not be able to grow unless the dominant mutant cells were eliminated.

2. Adjuvant therapy
Surgical removal of tumors can be traced back 5000 years. For solid tumors, it became standard practice to physically remove as much of a tumor as possible via surgery, followed by drugs or radiation. This approach proved useful because it reduced the doses of drugs or radiation required.

There ARE drawbacks to cancer surgery. First, many oncological surgery techniques are very aggressive; for example, radical mastectomy for breast surgery involves removing the breast, underlying pectoralis major muscle, subcutaneous fat, lymphatics, and occasionally more. Besides the cosmetic damage, the procedure leaves women with permanent loss of muscle balance and range of motion, and frequently with episodic limb swelling due to lymphedema. Similarly , the Whipple procedure is a technique for removing pancreatic tumors. Up to 50% of patients who undergo the procedure die during surgery or from complications soon after.

There also is growing concern that, in some types of cancer, surgical reduction of the primary tumor removes the source of signals that keep micro-metastases in check.

3. Gold standard testing
During this period, clinicians adopted a clinical trial strategy that still is used today. Clinical trials are structured so that a new drug is tested in combination with current best treatment. Patients either receive current standard treatment plus a placebo, or current standard treatment plus the investigational drug. It is very rare and extremely difficult to get permission to test a drug on its own. This approach benefits trial participants in they get at least the best current treatment option regardless of which treatment group the are assigned to. However, it leads to treatment regimens with more and more components, raising treatment costs. Also, compounds that would be effective alone but produce undesirable side effects when combined with others are unlikely to be approved.

The Micro View Era Was Both Good AND Bad For Cancer Biology
The latter half of the 20th century saw tremendous progress in understanding how cancer works. Studies of tumor viruses led to the discovery of oncogenes, which led to the discovery of other key regulatory proteins. Similarly, once we understood that cancer originated with mutations in DNA, geneticists and genomicists began to focus intently on understanding the genetic basis of familial disposition, and the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. It also was the beginning of the era of rational drug design, when compounds were synthesized for the express purpose of targeting a particular molecular process or pathway.

Unfortunately, it also was a time of mis-steps. As researchers moved out of whole animals and started focusing on cultured cell models, they remove the complex signaling environment and intercellular interactions that make cancer cells behave as they do. There have been many models of cancer progression based on cell culture studies that proved wrong once we moved back into whole animal models.

Simply moving back into animals was not enough though. During this period we learned that how cancer behaves in mice and rats is VERY different from how it behaves in humans. The path to cancer in rodents is fundamentally different than the path in humans. Rodent models still are valuable, but they must be chosen very carefully, with the understanding of their limitations.

Perhaps the greatest drawback of the cellular era was that it fostered a lack of appreciation for cancer's complexity.  Simple models based on cell culture led to an over-simplified view of cancer as rogue cells, or as a single disease to eradicate like smallpox.

Case in point: in 1971 President Richard Nixon declared a "War on Cancer" in a nationally televised address, and signed legislation that committed substantial federal funds to wiping it out. In the intervening 45 years, we have made tremendous strides towards understanding cancer, but we are nowhere near "eliminating the burden, suffering, and death of cancer." 

B5: 1990s to Today
The Systems-Level Era
Evidence from the last 20-30 years has led us to conclude that tumors are not simply masses of rogue cells, but actually  “rogue organs.” This view of cancer has changed how we think about its origins, its progression, how processes of vascularization and metastasis operate, and even how to treat it.

We know that an elaborate integrated circuit operates within normal cells which controls its growth and normal function. Separate subcircuits, depicted below in differently colored fields, are specialized to orchestrate the various capabilities.


In cancer cells this network is reprogrammed to produce hallmark features of cancer cells. Reprogramming starts with genetic mutations in a small population of cells that undergo unrelenting selection for the ability to grow without stimulation and to ignore normal growth regulation and control.

Keep in mind that even this diagram is too simple.

It does not show the relative strengths of the various signaling pathways, and does not show how the subsystems talk to one another.
Each cancer cell is exposed to a complex mixture of signals from its microenvironment that feed into the subcircuits.
It does not show how the signal networks change over time.

As internal controls fail, genes encoding proteins that regulate development and differentiation are activated inappropriately, so that cells develop some features of earlier states of differentiation, or trans-differentiate to new states.

As the population of defective cells expands they recruit nearby stromal and immune cells to create a complex pathological organ.  The complex mass triggers angiogenesis and further inflammation.
A General Model of Transformation Has Emerged: the Initiator-Promoter Model
Since 1900 cancer biologists have tried to link physical injury from radiation, chemical carcinogens, effects of lifestyle, and tumor viruses into a coherent general model that explains how all of them could contribute to cancer. One consensus model has emerged that can connect them successfully: the Initiator-Promoter Model (or I/P model for short). The I/P model states that the process of cell transformation occurs in two parts: initiation and promotion.

Initiation events create an initial, heritable change in the normal state of cells and tissues through genetic mutations or genomic damage. Errors during DNA replication, chemical modification of DNA (the mechanism by which most carcinogens act), free radical damage, viral insertions, genotoxic damage to DNA from ionizing radiation (X-rays, gamma rays, cosmic rays, etc.), and epigenetic modifications to DNA methylation are common initiation factors.

Promotion factors are any physical, chemical, or physiological stimulus or event  that promotes cell growth or turnover. Growth promotion increases the likelihood of cancer two ways. First, actively proliferating cells are more susceptible to injury by initiation factors. Second, when cells proliferate, the pool of cells containing damage from PRIOR damage increases. Growth may be promoted by almost any event that accelerates cell turnover. Some examples:

Activated oncogenes and inhibited tumor suppressors stimulate cell growth directly.
Mechanical damage.  Stomach, esophageal, and oral cancers have been linked to chronic alcohol consumption. Alcohol does not damage DNA directly, so it is not an initiator. Instead it is a promoter, because physically damaging the epithelial cells lining the mouth and upper gut increases cell turnover. 
Chemical damage from chronic inflammation. Inflammatory leukocytes release both oxygen radicals and chemical toxins that kill cells locally. Acute inflammation is protective, but chronic inflammation can over-stimulate inappropriate cell growth and repair.
Viral infections can act as both initiation and promotion events. Genomic damage results from viral insertions. Viral reproduction kills cells that must be replaced.
Some chemicals activate cell growth directly. For example, anabolic steroids (testosterone analogs) both stimulate muscle growth AND other cells.  

The I/P Model integrates two important features of cancer:

The effects of stochasticity, or random events. Cells are damaged constantly by random events. Only a small fraction of all these changes make cancer more likely. We think that these particular pro-cancer damage events are occurring in an orderly way because other stochastic events do not lead to an obvious, visible change. In reality, whether or not a SPECIFIC person will get cancer is based entirely on the frequency at which random events occur in their body.
The effects of accumulating probabilities. There are no substances that we can say are 100% certain to cause cancer. Instead, exposure to certain chemicals, physical events, etc., make cells more or less likely to undergo initiation. The probability of developing cancer is determined by how frequently our cells are exposed to all pro- transformation events. Put another way, even carcinogens like cigarette smoke are unlikely to lead to cancer if the exposures are rare or intermittent.

While the I/P Model has provided us with great insights into cancer, we are finding that this model still is not sufficient. I expect that over the next several years, a modified I/P/E Model is going to emerge. In it, there are initiation and promoting events, but also strong selection that causes the evolution of a tumor over time and space.
Metastasis – More Complex Than We Thought
For most of the 20th century, metastasis was thought to result from individual cancer cells breaking away from the primary mass and lodging in capillaries downstream from their starting point. In this view the sites of metastasis were determined by physical  blood flow. For example, colon cancer was most likely to disseminate to the liver because venous blood leaving the colon travels to the liver first. Lungs were a common site of metastasis for most cancers because the pulmonary capillary beds are the next destination for all venous blood returning from the body.

We know now that this view is too simple. Yes, the positions of metastases are partly determined by physical flow, but also by complex chemical interactions that occur before the colonizer cells ever break away . There is ample evidence that, for many cancers, the primary tumor releases chemical signals that prepare bone marrow and other distant sites for colonization BEFORE tumor cells leave the primary mass.

We also know now that tumors spread as mixed GROUPS of semi-specialized cells. Tumor cells can travel to metastatic locations in aggregates with the stromal and immune cells on which they depend. It is also now well established that when tumors are removed surgically but regrow in the same site, the second tumor probably is NOT derived from cells left behind when the first tumor was removed. Instead, it appears that micro-metastases located in other parts of the body migrate back to their point of origin, re-colonize the site, and regrow into the second tumor.
The image above shows a traveling heterogeneous mass. Blue is due to Wright-Giemsa stain, which differentiates normal marrow cells from metastatic cells. These aggregates move in blood, and can lie dormant for years as silent micrometastases.
Treatment is Finally Changing
In 2016, the main methods of treating cancer remain surgical reduction (when appropriate) followed by multi-drug chemotherapy or radiation. However, there are some additional tools available:

Rational drug discovery has provided clinicians with drugs that target specific steps in cancer signaling pathways. The best example is Gleevec, which is profiled in the next section. Other drugs targeting specific steps in key cancer processes are either in the pipeline or already in use in routine treatment.
Angiogenesis inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies targeting cancer markers are part of mainstream care.
Gene and vaccine therapies are starting to show promise in early clinical trials.

Gleevec: the First Rationally Designed Drug

The above image shows the stages of chronic myelogenous leukemia. This particular patient over-produces cells in the neutrophil lineage. Disease progression is associated with progressive loss of neutrophil differentiation.

In the left panel are 3 neutrophils. Two show the highly segmented nuclei that are typical of neutrophils in blood. The one nearest the top left corner though has two nuclear lobes that are more sausage-shaped. This is abnormal, and a symptom of the chronic stage of CML. The chronic phase can last for years.

The middle panel shows the accelerated phase, where nearly all neutrophils have abnormal, sausage-shaped nuclei. The arrow points to a myelogenous precursor cell. These cells should be restricted to bone marrow, and never seen in peripheral blood.

The right panel shows blood from a patient in a severe crisis state; there are no neutrophils present, only non-functional precursor cells.

CML is caused mainly by a translocation of part of the abl gene from Chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on Chromosome 22. The abl-bcr fusion protein is a constitutively active kinase that overstimulates myeloid leukocyte production. Gleevec is a compound that was designed using computational mapping of the enzyme binding site. Unlike chemotherapies, Gleevec inactivates the specific signaling pathway responsible for CML.

The image below shows two blood smears from a CML patient, one before treatment (top) and one after (bottom) treatment with Gleevec.

The research community has come to realize that preventing all cancer simply is not possible. The origins of cancer are buried in our DNA. The fundamental processes by which cancer develops are central to all eukaryotic cells. To eliminate all forms of cancer, we would need to eliminate fundamental cell functions. From this perspective, cancer cannot be simply wiped out like smallpox, polio, or river blindness. Rather than attempt to eradicate cancer we should focus on improving longevity and quality of life for patients.

Hallmark 1: Self-Sufficient Growth
We know that cells use complex, highly coordinated chemical signaling to stimulate and control growth. Tumor cells ignore these circuits and continue to grow in the absence of normal growth signals. But how?

To answer this question, we need to understand:

Endogenous signaling in general
Origins of oncogenes, and which genes can form them.
How heterotypic signals of integrins and ECM-anchored molecules are carried into cells.

The Discovery of Oncogenes
In the 1970s, Jim Bishop (below, right) and his postdoctoral fellow Harold Varmus (below, left)  were working with the Rous sarcoma virus trying to discover how it stimulated tumor formation. When the viral genome was sequenced, it turned out that the RSV virus actually was not a new virus, but rather the well-known avian leukosis virus (ALV), with an extra inserted DNA fragment. ALV normally causes mild illness in chickens. However RSV contains an additional gene, named src.


Their subsequent work showed that src was a gene captured from the chicken genome. Moreover, Bishop and Varmus found that every vertebrate they sampled had a gene similar to src in its genome. This body of work pointed to the possibility that the virus was simply a carrier for a tumor promoting gene that might be activated other ways. But could one gene actually transform cells?

In the late 1970s, after the src DNA fragment was discovered to be encoded by the chicken's own genome, the hunt was on to discover whether similar "oncogenes" existed in cells already. In several classic experiments conducted by multiple labs, investigators chemically treated mouse fibroblasts with 3-methylcholanthrene (shown below), a potent carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).
Chemical structure of methylcholanthrene
3-MC and many other PAHs are converted by liver enzymes into molecules that are initiators, that is, they can chemically react with DNA, creating mutations. Others are not initiators, but damage cells and promote cellular turnover.

In the experiment, mouse fibroblasts were mutagenized by 3-MC exposure, then lysed. Later experiments used DNA extracted from human tumor cell lines. DNA was isolated then sheared into random fragments, and introduced into healthy, normal 3T3 fibroblasts in culture. If transformed cells appeared, they were injected into mice to watch form tumor formation.

In both scenarios, mutated DNA alone was sufficient to transform normal cells - no virus needed. Assuming that it was unlikely to have 2 mutated genes next to each other, it was concluded that transformation could be accomplished by mutations to single genes.

(Hint of What's Ahead: ironically, we know now that one gene is NOT enough to transform cells in humans. Mice have very different genomic structure and what is sufficient to transform murine cells is not enough for human cells, because the human genome has additional regulatory elements necessary for a long-lived species that mice and rats lack. Our cells are much harder to transform.)
What IS the src Gene?
Sequencing and comparison the wild-type src gene (c-src)  in chickens and the viral src gene (v-src) in RSV uncovered significant differences.

The src protein has 4 well defined functional regions, called domains. Each domain has a distinct, specific folded shape and biological function. The names (SHx) are short for "src homology region #x".

SH1 domain: contains the tyrosine kinase activity
SH2 domain: recognizes, binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues (pTyr or pY)
SH3 domain: h’phobic pocket binds another protein via 2 spaced prolines
SH4 domain: acylation and methylation site targets src to membrane and holds it there.

Domains are evolutionarily conserved, meaning the SH2 domain of c-src from a chicken has a structure almost identical to the SH2 domain of human c-src. Other proteins may have SH2 domains as well, meaning they recognize and bind phospho-tyrosines.

Dozens of other functional domains have been identified that recognize specific regions of proteins, or specific chemical modifications. For example:

14-3-3 domains: bind pSer, pThr
FHA, MH2 domains: specific for pSer

Once the 3-dimensional structure (illustrated below) of c-src was worked out, it became clear why v-src was constitutively active, while c-src was tightly regulated.

At rest, c-src is anchored in the cell membrane by lipids attached to the SH4 domain. The SH2 domain binds to the Y-527 phsophorylated tyrosine, holding the kinase domain in an inactive state. When a signaling cascade containing c-src is activated, the Y-527 phosphate is removed, and SH1 domain phosphorylates itself on Y-416. The enzyme relaxes into an active conformation and can phosphorylate other targets to stimulate growth.

In mutant v-src, the Y-527 phosphorylation site is missing, so that src is constituitively ON. This is how v-src can be a continuous driver of growth.



Connections (Added Nov. 27, 2018)
This is an example of how to make connections to other topics. Many of the connections are based either on recommendations or suggestions for improvements in the Comments section.

Oncogenes are generated by genetic mutations, either in the promoter region (causing greater protein production), or coding region (that change how the protein function. Look on page H3B to learn more about how these mutations occur and page H3C for more about are repaired.

“How Signaling Fails” states that retroviruses like ALV/RSV capture oncogenes and cause cancer in animals. Follow this link to an outside overview of how retroviruses like RSV work: Kimball's Overview of RSV.

Viruses linked to human cancers affect pathways different from the Rous sarcoma virus, but the text doesn’t explain what these pathways are. Learn more about how a few human viruses disrupt normal cell function and promote cancer on this page from the National Cancer Institute. The reviews listed below go into still more detail.

The tumor mass that forms during Burkitt’s lymphoma is composed mainly of B-lymphocytes. Learn more about their function on page H6B, in the Adaptive Immunity section.

Philadelphia chromosome forms when chromosomes 9 and 22 are physically close enough for one arm to translocate. How is that possible? When unwound in interphase, cellular DNA is dispersed in the nucleus. Regions of many different chromosomes lie near each other. When they break, the non-homologous chromosomes are routinely re-connected by non-homologous end-joined (page H3C). The process works similarly to how homology-directed joining reconnects broken homologous chromosomes (see page H3C) or allows gene conversion (on page H3B).

Mutations that activate oncogenes (and therefore cell growth) are important, but not enough to force cells to grow out of control. Both specific tumor suppressor genes (see Page H2C) and the Rb cell cycle regulatory circuit (Page H2B) need to be inactivated or bypassed somehow. Read their associated pages to learn more.

Cadherins are one pathway by which cells can recognize and interact with their neighbors. To learn more about how cadherins and other adhesion molecules work, go to Tech Supplement Page 3 (Cell Connections) and Supplement Page 4 (Structure of ECM.) To learn more about how the subtypes of cadherins expressed by cells change during tumor development, go to LE1: Tumor Formation.

How do the cancer cells survive uncontrolled growth? Cells are pretty adept at recognizing when something is wrong and undergoing apoptosis or some other defense mechanism. Page H4B explores how additional mutations in p53 keep cells with over-active oncogenes alive.

As a follow-up to our discussion of Paik, 2012,  the authors based their study on an assumption that a patient cannot have two mutations that are leading to their tumor cells. In their discussion the authors themselves began to question their assumption. We now know that most tumors have multiple mutations. Go to Page H3: Genome Instability, and LE1: Tumor Formation to learn more about driver versus passenger mutations.
Carcinogen, mutagen, initiator, or promoter? What's the difference?
Which chemicals are mutagens (initiators) and which are growth promoters? Page B5: 1990s to Today provides in-depth descriptions of the difference between them. The distinction is not critical, because we know now that this classic two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model explains cancer cell transformation in rodents well, but is not sufficient to explain multistage carcinogenesis in humans. Still it helps to know the terminology because it remains in widespread use in literature, and is a helpful starting point for understanding the process in humans.

Initiators are some type of mutagen. Either they bind DNA covalently, intercalate into the DNA, generate radicals that damage DNA chains, or act indirectly by inhibiting DNA repair enzymes. The great majority of the officially recognized compounds or events that are listed as known or suspected carcinogens (see Tech Supplement 1: Carcinogens for an extensive list) are mutagenic, meaning they initiate cancer by damaging DNA.

Tumor promoters are a chemical, complex of chemicals, or a biological agent that promotes the later stages of growth by altering expression of genetic information, rather than altering the structure of DNA. There are far fewer tumor promoters than there are mutagens. The most commonly encountered ones are:

Steroids (estrogens, progestins, testosterone) and some other hormones
Phorbol esters (lipophilic molecules that activate PI3K and other growth stimulating paths) extracted from toxic plants
Aromatic chemicals and drugs that bind the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor and stimulate hepatocyte proliferation. Examples include:
Phenobarbital
PCBs
Dioxins
Chemicals or physical events that cause direct cell killing and replacement.  Examples include:
Ethanol (also stimulates hepatocyte proliferation)
Repeated physical injuries to areas exposed to mutagens
Inflammation is a promoter of tumor growth, but does not directly damage DNA.

Even fewer substances are complete carcinogens meaning they both initiate and promote carcinogenesis. The best examples of complete carcinogens are ionizing and electromagnetic radiation.

Side Trip: How Many Proteins Have SH2 domains?
Someone asked this and I suddenly HAD to know too!

Src was among the first proteins identified with an SH2 phosphotyrosine binding domain, but it was not the last. Current estimates are that the human genome encodes 20,000-27,000 different proteins. Of those, 110 proteins have at least one SH2 domain, and some have more than one.

ScienceDirect publishes research summary pages about thousands of topics. Check out what else we know about SH2 domains already on their summary page here:

H1b. A Primer on Kinase Signaling
There are many different kinds of receptors on the surface of cells. The table below shows just a few of the main types.

The receptor paths that are MOST likely to contribute to oncogenesis are:

Kinase receptors
Cell adhesion proteins
Matrix adhesion proteins


Regardless of what the ligand is, most receptor-based signaling pathways are arranged similarly. There is a transmembrane receptor that activates a G-protein, which in turn activates cytoplasmic molecules that carry the signal to its final destinations. The final output steps differ between signaling paths, but in general signaling will either change gene expression, change cell trafficking, alter cell physiology or shape, or change how the cell interacts with its environment. Invariably, the signaling path will branch and connect with others. Also, the signaling path will have some kind of mechanism for inactivating itself again.


Kinase Receptor Signaling
The c-src protein that Bishop and Varmus discovered is part of the kinase receptor family of signaling pathways. Kinase receptors are so named because they have surface ligand binding domains that activate intracellular kinases. The initial kinase activity triggers intracellular changes that can lead to proliferation of the cell, among other changes.

Schematic of the most common kinase receptors
Kinase receptors usually are single-pass receptors. The extracellular domains vary greatly in structure, but most bind to protein or peptide ligands. The kinase domain is highly conserved, and has structure similar to the SH1 domain of src. The best understood kinase receptor system is the one for epidermal growth factors (EGFs). It was the first to be worked out, and has been implicated in many cancer types.
Steps in Kinase Signaling
The ligands for kinase receptors usually are proteins secreted by nearby cells. In the example below, epithelial cells are secreting PDGF (platelet derived growth factor) that activates receptors on adjacent mesodermally derived cells. Concurrently, the mesodermal cells are secreting TGF-α, a member of the EGF (epidermal growth factor) family. Both cell types are secreting growth factors for the nearby cells on which they depend. This is called paracrine signaling.


When a ligand binds, the receptors dimerize then transphosphorylate each other. Most target tyrosine amino acid residues, but some signaling paths can phosphorylate serines or threonines.


Next, phospho-amino acids attract adapter proteins containing specific binding  domains. Which proteins a receptor will attract depends on the spacing of the phospho-amino acids, and the amino acids that surround the phosphorylated site. For example, the illustration below shows the known intermediate adapter proteins that bind to PDGF and EGF receptors. All of the bound adapter proteins recognize pTyr residues. Which residues they bind is quite different though.

The PDGF receptor has two phosphorylated tyrosines at positions 579 and 581, and each has an adjacent hydrophobic amino acid (580=isoleucine, 582=valine). Of the many proteins with SH2 domains, only Src proteins have an SH2 domain that can bind to this specific motif. In contrast the phospho-amino acid closest to the membrane for the EGF receptor is residue pTyr-845, with histidine, alanine, and glutamate at positions 846-848. Only the SH2 domain of the STAT3/5 adapter can recognize and bind a pTyr with those three amino acids next to it.


Not all of the adapters are unique. Some bind to BOTH receptors. Look at pTyr 1021 in the PDGF receptor, and pTyr 992 in the EGF receptor. Both have the same motif: phosphotyrosine followed by 2 hydrophobic amino acids (2 isoleucines, or a leucine/isoleucine), then a proline (P). This is the standard binding motif for PLC-γ (phospholipase C-gamma).

The variety of adapters is important because they connect each receptor to multiple signaling pathways. For example, when EGF molecules bind to their receptor, signals are sent to ALL of these paths via the different adapters:

Adapter
Path
STAT3/5

Activates DNA to prevent apoptosis
PLCγ

Alters cell calcium signaling, balance
Shc
Activates Ras proliferation path
Cbl
Down-regulates receptor by increasing endocytosis, ubiquitin tagging, proteolysis
JAK2
Activates protein synthesis, stimulates cell cycle progression via PI3 kinase path
Grb2
Activates Ras proliferation path
SHP1
Prevents over-activation of JAK2
PTP1	Phosphatase 1; removes phosphate groups to inactivate pathways


Adapters Connect Receptors to Ras Family of Monomeric G-proteins
Like all G-proteins, Ras family members are inactive on their own. They have a guanlyate binding pocket, and internal GTPase activity. At rest, Ras is inactive, with GDP bound. Activated receptors attract one or more adapter proteins that are guanylate exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs remove GDP and replace it with GTP, activating the Ras molecule.
Activated Ras molecules will slowly hydrolyze their bound GTP to GDP, which silences signaling again. Ras GTPase activity can be stimulated by additional proteins called GTPase activation proteins, or GAPs. Most of the partners that Ras recruits when it is activated have some type of GAP activity.

Downstream of Ras Are Kinases and Transcription Factors
The entire process up to this point has occurred near the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane. The molecules recruited and activated by Ras transmit the signal from the cell membrane through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. They also serve to amplify the signal.


In the EGF receptor pathway, Ras recruits a multi-function molecule called Raf. It is a GAP, and so inactivates Ras signaling. Raf also is a serine/threonine kinase; in the presence of active Ras, Raf phosphorylates members of the Mek family of kinases. Meks in turn phosphorylate Erk1 and Erk2, also known as MAPK1/2 (short for mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 and 2, respectively.)

The final step in the cascade occurs when Erk 1/2 (or equivalent proteins) move from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate transcription factors (which were called "mitogen activated proteins" once upon a time) to modify gene activity.

The complete EGF receptor signaling network, including all major sub-pathways, is shown below.

H1c. Homotypic & Heterotypic Signaling
How Do Cells Know What Is Around Them?

Cells in multicellular organisms cannot operate in isolation. They must sense the physical molecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding them, make connections to it, and regulate those connections so that the cells remain in place when necessary, but can move when needed. Cells in multicelled organisms also must be able to identify and connect to one another, and respond appropriately to changes in their neighboring cells.
Focal Adhesions: Substrate As Ligand

A cultured fibroblast growing on a sheet of pre-formed extracellular matrix. Actin stress fibers have been fluorescently stained green.  Integrin proteins in the focal adhesions  have been stained orange (short tips of fibers.)

The photograph above shows the actin stress fibers in a cultured fibroblast. The green filaments are composed of thousands of repeated acting monomers connected end to end to form fibers. The orange fluorescent points where the stress fibers connect to the cell membrane are called focal adhesions. 

Focal adhesions are important for several reasons.

A cell changes its shape by changing the organization of its cytoskeleton. The focal adhesions are the anchor points around which that re-organization occurs.
Focal adhesions link the internal cytoskeleton to the external extracellular matrix.
Receptors and signaling intermediates located in and near focal adhesions provide detailed information about the cell's physical interactions with its local environment.

Heterotypic Signals - How Cells Sense the ECM
Integrins are the central molecules in focal adhesions, and they are the only proteins extending across the plasma membrane. They are heterodimeric receptors. Their external domains bind to ECM molecules. The integrins are the primary molecules through which cells sense the composition of their surrounding ECM.

There are dozens of possible combinations of integrins, each of which will bind some ECM molecules but not others. For example, a particular integrin pair may bind Type I collagen tightly, but not bind Type IV collagens at all. Cells with this integrin pair would bind tightly to ECM rich in Type I collagen, but might not bind to a matrix containing Type IV collagens at all. Other integrins  only bind to fibronectin, laminin, or specific glycosaminoglycans.

When integrins bind, the intracellular domain undergoes conformational changes trigger focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Integrins do not have their own kinase domains; FAK performs that function for them. 

FAK phosphorylation of the integrin internal domain and other nearby proteins attracts other signaling intermediates and adapter proteins. The initial binding signal branches out to multiple pathways.

One branch controls the actin cytoskeleton through the Rho, Rac, and cdc42 proteins.
These are members of the Ras superfamily, and use many of the same intermediates. However, Rho-type proteins control the organization of the cytoskeleton.
Rho/Rac/cdc42 stimulate the actin cytoskeleton to organize  in a tissue-specific pattern, based on what molecules are present in the ECM. This is partly how cells "know" what shape to form in a given tissue environment.
A second branch from FAK signals to one of the 3 Ras proteins.
This signal is required for progression of the cell cycle and proliferation. It is why cells require a substrate in order to proliferate.
Signaling intermediates link to and activate other signaling sub-paths, informing the cell of the current status of its connection to ECM.
Another path (not shown below) helps cells orient themselves within the tissue space. For epithelial cells, that means which part of the cell is the basal region, and which part is the apical region facing the open environment.

Homotypic Signaling - How Cells Identify Their Neighbors
Cells also have specific receptors that identify whether the adjacent cell is the same type or not. These receptors are the cadherins (short for Ca-dependent adherent junction proteins). There are 3 main types of cadherins:

E-cadherins are found mainly in epithelial cells
N-cadherins are produced by mesodermal and neural cells
P-cadherins are less common. They are produced by platelets and some other cells.

Each cadherin class will only bind to itself. Cells with E-cadherins will not use them to connect to cells with N-cadherins on their surface.

The cadherins are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through a class of proteins called the catenins. Catenins have a mechanical function of connecting cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. β-catenin ALSO is central to signaling. It acts as an intracellular signal transducer in the Wnt signaling pathway, which helps control cell proliferation. Without going into details, if the cadherin is not bound to a partner, it frees β-catenin, which migrates to the nucleus and activates genes linked to proliferation via cyclin D/cdk4/6 complexes, and pRb.

This is partly how cells know if there is another cell of the same type next to them.


H1d. How Signaling Fails
How Do Signaling Networks Go Awry?
While examples of other receptor classes have been mutated in cancers, the kinase receptor paths (along with their ligands, intermediates, and regulator molecules) are more likely to be mutated in cancer cells. Changes in signaling cell-cell (homotropic) and cell-matrix (heterotropic) receptors also happens frequently.

Given the complexity of signaling networks it is little surprise that there are errors from time to time. Several decades of research by cancer biologists have uncovered some common themes and mechanisms underlying deranged signaling. This is not an exhaustive survey, in part because new mechanisms are discovered regularly. We will see others as we read the primary literature.
1. Gene Adoption and Mutation
RSV is the most obvious example of this strategy. The v-src oncogene entered the viral genome from chickens when avian leukosis virus (ALV) integrated upstream of the c-src coding region. As ALV viral RNAs were transcribed, at least one experienced a run-through error and skipped its transcriptional stop site. The polymerase read through to the c-src gene, and incorporated all but the final tyrosine into the viral genome. Once packaged into a retrovirus, the nascent RSV passed from cell to cell carrying its adopted, damaged gene fragment.

Table 3.3 from the textbook (below) lists other retroviruses that have adopted aberrant versions of normal genes.

2. Viral Insertion Effects
Viruses that insert into the genome of a cell can create conditions for over-expression of oncogenes. The illustration below summarizes the results of a study in which birds were infected with ALV, then screened for B-cell lymphomas. In most of the birds developing B-cell lymphomas, the ALV virus had integrated upstream of the c-Myc oncogene. The virus did not target c-Myc specifically. Rather, most insertion sites did not produce a change in DNA that gave cells a protective advantage. Only those birds where ALV inserted in the genome upstream of c-Myc developed lymphomas.


Viral insertion like ALV in c-Myc is rare in human cancer. All viruses linked to cancer in humans act through other pathways. However, the ALV/c-Myc experiment does show us a plausible mechanism for activating an oncogene that is similar to the next mechanism.
3. Gene Translocations
Gene translocations are mass movements of a segment of one chromosome to another location within the genome. Translocations are a significant source of oncogene activation in human cancers.
Example A: Burkitt’s Lymphoma
Burkitt lymphoma is a type of cancer restricted the central sub-Saharan Africa. The key oncogenic driver is the c-myc gene. This gene is found at 8q24.  Three variants are seen in Burkitt lymphoma patients; all are translocations.

The most common variant is t(8;14)(q24;q32), which accounts for about 85% of cases. This involves translocation of the c-myc growth activator to the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene.
Two less common variants move c-Myc to other immunoglobulin chain genes. B-lymphocytes normally would synthesize Ig chains for antibodies continuously. The c-Myc translocation means they now  produce a potent pro-growth transcription factor continuously. Ultimately this leads to formation of solid masses of tumor cells originating from the B-lymphocyte lineage.

Example B: Leukemias Linked to the Philadelphia Chromosome
In 1960, medical cytologists working in Philadelphia noted an unusual chromosomal abnormality among patients with various forms of leukemia. By 1982, it had been shown that the "Philadelphia chromosome" represents a translocation between the long arms of Chromosomes 9 and 22.




The translocation creates a fusion protein between the N-terminal portion of the BCR protein on Chromosome 22, and the C terminal section of the Abl protein from Chromosome 9. Bcr is short for "breakpoint cluster region." It is a serine/threonine kinase with uncertain activity that is expressed routinely by myeloid cells. Abl is short for "Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1." It has roles in cell differentiaiton, division, and cell adhesion. It contains an SH3 domain that is the MAIN negative regulator region for the protein.

The fusion has two effects. First it deletes the main SH3 regulatory domain for the Abl protein, and second, Abl now has a higher activity promoter.

There is one consistent break point in the Abl gene but 3 alternate insertion points in Bcr. Each insert site slightly changes how the fusion protein operates. The results are consistent enough to predict which type of leukemia is most likely based on where the break in Bcr occurred.

Fusion of Abl with a short Bcr segment is most associated with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)
Fusion of Abl to the middle breakpoint in Bcr is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
Fusion of Able to the distal breakpoint in Bcr  produces the largest fusion protein, which is linked to chronic neutrophilic leukemia.


Other Clinically Observed Translocations


As more cancer samples are sequenced, we are discovering that many genes undergo translocation. The figure above shows several frequently translocated signaling receptors, and the genes to which they were fused.

The RET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase for members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of extracellular signalling molecules. Overactive RET is linked to  medullary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasias type 2A and 2B, pheochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia.

ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase similar to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein. The exact role of the ROS1 protein in normal development is uncertain, but translocation and overactivity is linked to lung and other cancers.

MET is a tyrosine kinase receptor essential for embryonic development, organogenesis and wound healing. Its ligands are hepatocyte growth factor/Scatter Factor (HGF/SF), NK1, and NK2. MET is normally expressed by epithelial cells of epithelial origin, while HGF/SF is produced by mesenchymal cells. Abnormal MET activation in cancer correlates with poor prognosis. Excess MET triggers tumor growth, formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that supply the tumor with nutrients, and metastasis to other organs.
4. Activating Mutations
We have encountered activating mutations previously. The c-terminal end of the c-src protein in chickens is missing from v-src. Briefly, this region contains Tyr-527, the main site required to fold Src into an inactive form. Without Tyr-527, the SH-2 domain of Src cannot hold the kinase domain in an inactive state, and Src continuously signals the cells to grow.

Ras is another protein that undergoes activating mutations. It is estimated that 25% of all human cancers have an activating mutation in 1 of the 3 Ras genes (K-Ras, N-Ras, H-Ras) or in a member of the Ras superfamily of G-proteins (Rho, Rac, cdc42).

Below is a map of the amino acid sequence of Exon 1 of Ras.



The amino acids in the first row make up the P-loop region of Ras, which is where Raf and other signaling proteins with GAP activity interact with Ras. A 1-nt mutation in Gly-12 (Gly12Val) is sufficient to block GAP interactions with Ras. The intrinsic GAP activity of Ras is extremely slow; without external GAP activation of the GTPase, the GTP will remain in place indefinitely. Other mutations have been observed in Ras, but most are in Gly-12. Gly-13 is a minor mutation site, but is seen less often. One other mutation is common in cancer cells: Q61K. This mutation is inside the GTPase catalytic site, and prevents it from binding to the GTP.

It is likely that Ras is mutated in many other places than just these 3 sites. However, the other mutations do not seem to have the same capacity to inactivate GTPase activity and turn Ras on permanently. As a result, these mutations have not survived to become part of the pool of cells in the typical tumor mass.
5. Gene Truncation; Gene Copy Amplification
Normally, kinase signaling requires the presence of the ligand before two receptor molecules can come close enough together to undergo transphosphorylation. In some cancers, the ligand binding domain of the receptor has been decapitated or otherwise mutated so that physical or steric hindrance is no longer present (see above figure, top right panel). Now the receptors can come together and transphosphorylate in the absence of ligand.

Molecular crowding also can activate an oncogene inappropriately. If a receptor gene is duplicated 2-3 times but is unchanged otherwise, the cell will produce much more of the receptor protein, increasing the probability of random activation in the absence of ligand. This has been observed for patients with tumors in which the HER2 gene has been amplified through duplication. The Kaplan-Meier curves below show disease-free survival as a proportion of the total population for two cohorts: patients without HER2 amplifications, and patients with them. The data clearly show that amplification of the HER2 receptor accelerates disease progression.



Increased copy number of other genes besides receptors can have similar effects. Look at the data below for patients with vs. without amplification of the N-Myc transcription factor gene. Again, extra copies of the oncogene is correlated to greater risk of cancer returning.

What Causes Gene Duplications?
Gene duplications are a result of mutation, with many causes.

There are examples of inherited gene duplications, but they are rare
Unequal crossover during meiosis or mitosis can cause duplications
Replication slippage has been shown to cause duplications
Non-disjunction and aneuploidy are frequent causes of duplication

6. Indirect De-regulation
One final mechanism for over-activating oncogenes is to eliminate normal inhibitory mechanisms. This mechanism will lead us into a discussion of tumor supressor genes, since many of them control oncogenes.

One important regulatory system that has emerged recently is the microRNA regulatory network. MicroRNAs are typically 22nt long, and bind to complementary sites in the 5' UTR, 3' UTR, or introns of target mRNAs. Double-stranded RNAs that are not chemically protected are subject to destruction by a large ribonuclease complex within the cell.

When microRNAs are unable to bind to target mRNAs, the proteins those mRNAs code for will be over-produced by the cells. An example of this in cancer is the Let-7 microRNA/HMG2a system.


HMG2a in one of the  architectural proteins of the enhanceosome. It is a major developmental gene regulator that is critical during early development. Once development is complete, HMG2a is not needed. It is kept in check by let-7 microRNAs. There are 7 Let-7 binding sites in the 3' UTR of HMG2a. Any mRNA produced is quickly tagged by Let-7 and degraded. 

In several cancers, a mutation or translocation of HMG2a has removed the 3' UTR, and so removed the main mechanism for preventing HMG2a protein synthesis. Early development genes and programs are reactivated, leading to unregulated cell growth.

Which Oncogenes Drive a Particular Type of Cancer (and Why Should We Care)?
Paper:
Paik, Johnson, et al. 2012. Driver mutations determine survival in smokers and never-smokers with Stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinomas. Cancer. 118:5840-7.
Background
The photo below shows a typical lung adenocarcinoma. The left panel shows how the cells form an undifferentiated mass. The right panel shows how the tumor extends from the main mass with finger-like projections.


It is well known that "never-smokers" who smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime are more likely to live longer than smokers and former smokers. The question is, WHY?

Paik et al. think that dividing lung cancer patients based just on their smoking history is overlooking important differences.

Below is the map of signaling interactions linked to the ErbB receptor. The authors believe the driver mutation (red boxes; another name for the most active mutation driving or permitting growth) is different between never-smokers vs. smokers.



If true, the mutation will affect which category of treatment patients with lung cancer should receive. Identifying oncogene genetic marker differences could help clinicians decide which treatment would be most beneficial.
Methods:

Patients at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center with lung adenocarcinomas between 2002 and 2009 were asked to participate. Their tumors were screened for mutations in known driver oncogenes.
Mutation Screens
Deletion from the EGF Receptor were screened for using PCR
The assay identifies deletions from Exon 19, which contains part of the tyrosine kinase domain. This is the most common EGFR change seen in NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma.)  Samples also were screened for a specific Exon 21 L858R point mutation that also is common in NSCLC.

This is their EGFR Exon 19 “Mut-Map” showing the various deletions in the kinase domain they observed. The mutation maps below showed which mutation patterns were most common in patients that had an EGFR mutation.


Mutations in KRas were Identified by direct sequencing.
They specifically looked for the G12V, -D, -C, -S, -A mutations, and the G13D mutation.



Translocations of ALK to EML4 were screened for using PCR and FISH.
ALK is short for anaplastic lymphoma kinase. EML4 is a microtubule stablization protein. Both genes are on Chromosome 2p21.

EML4 can be translocated to the ALK's upstream region. When this happens, it replaces the normal promoter for ALK with the promoter for EML4 that is more active. The fusion protein that is produced also is missing a regulatory site, so has constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity. 


The authors used a fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) probe with two colored tags. Each half of the tag was complementary to adjacent parts of the ALK coding region, on either side of the most frequently observed breakpoint. If EML4 has inserted, the two colored probes will bind at different sites in nuclei.
Results 
Key Finding 1:
The frequency of each driver mutation is different in never-smokers and smokers.
In both groups, ~44% of patients did not have a driver mutation in 1 of the 3 genes they evaluated. However, never smokers had nearly 3 times as many mutations in EGFR as smokers (38% vs. 14%), and 6 times as many ALK-EML4 translocations (12% vs. 2%, respectively.) Smokers had 8 times more mutations in KRas than never smokers (41% vs. 5% respectively.) They concluded that there WAS a significant difference in the types of mutations in the two groups evaluated.


Key Finding 2:
There is a difference in overall survival depending on which mutation is present, but it does not matter whether patients smoked.

The K-M curves below compare overall survival between smokers and never smokers who have each of the 3 mutations they evaluated.

These tables summarize the median overall survival and mutation frequencies.



Their data indicate that the median survival for a patient does not really depend on whether or not they smoked. Overall survival is correlated to which mutation is present.

Patients with KRas mutations survive a median time of 11 months.
Patients with EGFR mutations survive a median time of 23 months.
Patients with ALK translocations survive a median time of 35 months. 

The difference in survival between smokers and never smokers can be explained by the differences in how many have each mutation.

8 times as many smokers have the KRas mutation, which is correlated to shortest median survival.
6 times as many never smokers have the ALK translocation, which has the longest median survival.

What Are Treatment Implications?
Patients with activating mutations in tyrosine kinases can be treated with members of the tyrphostin class of tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs. Patients with EGF receptor activation can be treated effectively using gefitinib (Iressa), erlotinib (Tarceva), or 2nd generation EGFR inhibitors. Patients with ALK translocations can be treated with the TKI crizotinib (Xalkori)

Patients with KRas mutations are harder to treat, because they do not respond positively to TKIs. Drugs like sorafinib have been tried, but had little benefit. This is not surprising; KRas is not a tyrosine kinase, nor is it a serine/threonine kinase.  There has been some success with inhibitors of Mek1 and Mek2, which are the S/T kinases downstream of Raf (which is activated by Ras.)
Unanswered Questions

What are the driver mutations in the remaining 40% of patients? The authors suggest HER2 (a member of the EGFR family), or loss of the BRAF tumor suppressor. However they leave this question mostly unexplored.
Are the ALK fusion, KRas, EGFR mutations really mutually exclusive? Why?
The authors did not make a major point of this, but they did not exclude patients from the study who had been previously treated with TKI inhibitors. Is it possible that their data are skewed by selection based on TKI susceptibility or resistance?

H2A: Brief History
The Discovery of Tumor Suppressors

After the discovery of oncogenes in the 1960s and 1970s, many thought we could adequately explain both viral origins of some cancers, as well as the link to mutagens. 

In the 1980's the Sendai viral fusion experiments provided a way to determine whether a particular phenotype was due to dominant or recessive genes. Sendai virus has a fusigenic coat protein, meaning cells exposed to the protein fuse together to form multi-nucleated hybrid cells. Below is an example of Sendai virus-mediated fusion of mouse fibroblasts to ape renal cells. 


In one of the important experiments normal cells were fused with cancerous cells, then screened for heterokaryons (cells with two nuclei, one from each donor cell.)  One of two outcomes was predicted. Either:

The genes responsible for the cancerous cell phenotype would be dominant, and so would be observed even in the presence of a normal genome, OR
The transformed phenotype would NOT be seen, because the genes responsible for cancer are recessive. 



From the results of work on src and other oncogenes, it was expected that cancer-causing genes would prove to have dominant inheritance patterns. That is NOT what was observed though. Depending on what tumor cell line was used, sometimes the tumorigenic mutation behaved like a dominant gene, and sometimes like a recessive gene. The overall conclusions:

Cancer is probably a result of more than one gene.
Some of those genes are driving growth, so only need one copy (dominant pattern)
Other genes are restricting growth, so BOTH copies have to be eliminated (recessive pattern)



Pediatric Retinoblastoma and the Discovery of Rb
Retinoblastoma is a rare form of cancer that develops in the retinal epithelium of the eye. Treatment is complete surgical removal of the affected eye. Pediatric retinoblastoma is not common (under 20,000 cases annually), and it strikes at a very young age (almost no cases appear in children aged 12 or older.)



Alfred Knudson was a pediatric oncologist specializing in retinoblastoma. His team identified two distinct subtypes of pediatric retinoblastoma: unilateral and bilateral.

Unilateral, also known as sporadic, occurs in one eye, and 50% of these cases appear within the first 30 months of a child’s life. There is no inherited pre-disposition to it.
Bilateral, also know as familial, strikes both eyes, but is not due to metastasis; each tumor arises independently. 50% of patients with bilateral retinoblastoma develop it within the first 7 months of life. Bilateral retinoblastoma strikes multiple generations of a family, suggesting there is a genetic predisposition to it that is passed from generation to generation.

Knudson and his colleagues graphed the fraction of cases against age for each of the two forms, and found that they followed different patterns.

The rate at which bilateral disease appears has a linear correlation to age; in other words, ONE event is necessary for disease to occur.
The rate at which unilateral disease appears has a power correlation to age; in other words, TWO separate events must happen for disease to occur. 



From these findings, Knudson concluded that TWO mutations of DNA are needed for retinoblastoma to develop in patients with unilateral disease. Only one eye is affected because two mutations occurring in the same cell is probably a rare event. Conversely, patients with bilateral/familial disease inherit one of the two mutations needed. As a result, they only need one more mutation to predispose the retinal cells to tumor formation.



This discovery by itself might have earned Knudson the Nobel Prize, but his team ALSO identified the gene responsible: retinoblastoma, or Rb. They also gave us the phrase "tumor suppressor genes.

H2B: Rb Protein is THE Cell Cycle Regulator

Tumor suppressor genes are responsible for ensuring that normal cells do not proliferate except when conditions are appropriate. Most TSGs either directly or indirectly regulate growth via cyclin/cdks, pro-growth transcription factors, or the checkpoints of the cell cycle. To understand how this works, we need to understand "state landscapes," and the cell cycle.
Cells Live in a State Landscape

Cells exist in an ever-changing sea of signals and information. Based on their internal conditions and the external signals, cells move between three permanent states:

Non-Cycling or Senescent: cell is unable to divide. The fine distinction between them is not critical to understand right now.
Mitotic: cell is either actively dividing, or preparing to do so.
Apoptotic: cell is actively breaking itself down in a process of self-destruction that protects neighboring cells.

There is a fourth state shown: quiescent. This is not a stable state. Rather, it is the time when a cell is not actively preparing to divide, but waiting for appropriate signals telling it to do so.

When a cell is quiescent and receives signals that stimulate mitosis, it commits to completing the entire process of DNA replication and cell division. Mistakes have catastrophic consequences to the cell, so if it fails to complete mitosis correctly and return to the original quiescent state, the internal cascade is triggered that drives the cell into apoptosis. Again, once a cell commits to apoptosis, it cannot come back.
Overview of the Cell Cycle
The cell cycle is the process of a cell moving from quiescent to mitosis and back. During S-phase DNA is replicated, and the replicated DNA is separated into two daughter cells during M-phase.  In between these phases are two "gap" phases: G1 and G2. Once thought to be inactive stages, we know now that G1 and G2 are very active stages in the cell life cycle as well.


The Cell Cycle Has Major Checkpoints
These are the main checkpoints where a cell "decides" whether to go forward to the next stage of the cell cycle, wait, or stop trying to proceed and enter apoptosis.

There are TWO checkpoints during G1 phase. The first checkpoint is called the G1 restriction point, or simply, R-point.  The R-point is where the final decision to attempt cell division is made. It is controlled by the Rb protein. R-point also is the only checkpoint where cells respond to mitogens and other signals from their external environment. The other checkpoints are regulated by internal conditions within the cell itself.

The second checkpoint is late in G1 phase. Cells only move through this checkpoint if there are sufficient stored ATP, nucleotides, histones for completing DNA replication.

The next checkpoint in S phase is actually a series of smaller checkpoint during DNA replication. Together, they signal that the cell has completed DNA replication successfully.

The fourth checkpoint in G2 phase evaluates whether the cell is ready to undergo mitosis.

Like the S phase checkpoint, there are multiple smaller checkpoints during each stage of mitosis. The most important of these is at the end of metaphase, when all of the condensed chromosomes have aligned and are ready to be separated into daughter cells. If a cell passes the metaphase checkpoint too soon, one or more duplicated chromosomes will not be separated properly. Both daughter cells will have incorrect chromosome counts (aneuploidy).

Each Checkpoint Is Controlled by Cyclins and cdks

Cyclins are proteins that are synthesized at specific stages of the cell cycle. Their concentration in the cell rise until they peak just before a checkpoint. As the cell passes the checkpoint, the cyclins are degraded. The relative concentrations of each major cyclin is shown on the cell cycle map near the top of this page.

Cyclins do not act alone. They form heterodimers with cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) that phosphorylate specific targets and thus control cell cycle processes. Each of the pairs also has 2+ inhibitory proteins. The main cyclins, cdks, and inhibitor proteins for human cells are shown below.

Cyclin/cdk pairs will only phosphorylate specific substrates. Substrate specificity ensures that the cell cycle can only go in one direction. For example:

CyclinD/ cdk4/6 can mono-phosphorylate unphosphorylated Rb protein, but cannot act on poly-phosphorylated Rb.
Likewise, Cyclin E/cdk2 can further phosphorylate mono-pRb, but it cannot affect unphosphorylated Rb.
This means Cyclin D has to act first, before Cyclin E can act; Cyclin E cannot force a cell to pass the R point.

Rb is phosphorylated further by In this way, the cyclin-CDK pairs will control the cell cycle at the R point, either hyper-phosphorylating the Rb protein to release E2F or leaving it bound to it without phosphorylating it.
How Does Rb Control Cell Cycle Progression?

Current evidence indicates that Rb must be activated in steps. Until it is correctly activated, Rb blocks the function of E2F transcription factors, which in turn control all of the genes required for a cell to progress through the G1 checkpoint and enter S phase.

(Note: the model in your textbook IS drawn correctly; the labels are not clear, which is why I did not think it was the right one. I apologize - ADJ)

When cells first emerge from mitosis, Rb is un-phosphorylated (Panel A above.) It can bind and silence E2F transcription factors.

As cells continue in G1 and recover function, they begin to transcribe Cyclin D. As Cyclin D levels rise, it pairs with cdk4/6, and the cell becomes sensitive to growth stimulation by growth factors.

When Cyclin D/cdk4/6 MONO-phosphorylates Rb (Panel B), the arm that holds the histone deacetylase in place moves, which PARTLY releases silencing of E2Fs. At this stage:
Mono-P-Rb/E2F complexes ACTIVATE transcription of Cyclin E gene.
Mono-P-Rb STILL BLOCKS transcription of all other E2F dependent genes.

Cyclin E builds up, pairs with its cdk, and POLY-phosphorylates Rb (poly-P-Rb; Panel C). The poly-P-Rb releases completely from E2F transcription factors, and all of the E2F-dependent genes are activated.

While the cell is in mitosis, phosphatases remove all the phosphate groups so that Rb is inactive again (not shown). This step acts as a failsafe; naked Rb defaults the new post-mitotic cells to differentiated state, or senescence.

So What Regulates Rb Phosphorylation?



If we trace growth stimulating pathways from their starting signal, nearly all signaling pathways converge on Rb somehow. Looking at the panel above, a mitogenic signal can:

Up-regulate transcription of Cyclin D or E directly
Increase the activity of their partner cdks
Reduce the concentration or activity of a cdk INHIBITOR

Similarly, external and internal signals that BLOCK growth (panel below) do so by:

Stimulating synthesis or activation of the INK4 family members. These are all proteins that form a hetero-trimer complex and so inactivate Cyclin D/cdk4/6.
Stimulating synthesis or activation of the Cyclin E inhibitors. The two most important Cyclin E inhibitors are p21 and p27. Both proteins are activated by DNA damage, and are how the cell pauses the cell cycle so it can repair the DNA.




So What? Why Is Rb Important to Cancer?
Errors in Rb regulation are among the most common gene errors seen in cancer. For many types of cancer, up to 90% of sampled tumors have some kind of mutation in the Rb regulatory system. The tables below show the types of mutations seen, and the frequency of Rb regulatory defects in various types of cancer.

H2C: Specialized Tumor Suppressors

Mutation in the Rb regulatory axis is central to many types of cancer, but it is not the only tumor suppressor. There are other growth inhibitors that act more specifically or in a smaller range of cell types. Below are two examples.
PTEN - A Signal Path-specific Tumor Suppressor
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) is a phosphatase that converts the lipid signaling molecule PIP3 back to PIP2. By doing so, PTEN inactivates a signaling path that branches off from the EGF/EGFR/Ras path. It also directly inactivates signaling from receptors that use PIP3 as their second messenger.

The list of PIP3-dependent signals includes:

Chemokines used in cell to cell communication
Several hormones
Integrins and focal adhesions
Toll-like receptors/PAMPs (important in inflammatory responses)

Like Rb, there are families with heritable mutations in PTEN, and individuals often have spontaneous mutations in PTEN. Currently we know that:

PTEN is mutated in 60-70% of advanced glial, prostate cancers
It has been linked to breast, endometrial cancers, and to melanoma 
Generally, absence of PTEN is linked to shorter survival and more aggressive tumor growth.

APC/Beta-Catenin: Central Players in Colon Cancer

Tissue-specific tumor suppressors have important roles in cancers of specific organs. The best-known example of this is colon cancer. The images below show a normal colon (right) with a smooth surface, and the polyp-covered surface of the colon (left) of a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). These individuals inherit a mutation in APC, a tumor suppressor  protein that regulates normal turnover of the colon epithelium.

The epithelial surface of the colon is made up of enterocytes. These cells begin as undifferentiated stem cells in the bottom of microscopic pits called crypts. The stem cells receive the growth factor Wnt from their underlying fibroblasts, start dividing, and also start moving up the wall of the crypt (left half of panel below).

In the ABSENCE of Wnt, a transcription co-factor called beta-catenin is blocked from migrating to the nucleus by a large protein complex (panel below, left side). The main scaffolding protein for that complex is APC. APC holds beta-catenin in the complex until it is tagged and sent to the proteasome for destruction.

The only way enterocyte stem cells receive their signal to proliferate is if Wnt is present (see panel below, right side). Under normal conditions, Wnt binds its receptor on undifferentiated stem cells, and prevents APC from forming its beta-catenin-capturing complex. Now the transcription co-factor can migrate to the nucleus and stimulate proliferation. 
NORMALLY, as proliferating enterocytes move up the crypt wall, they move away from their source of Wnt. APC is not blocked, beta-catenin is destroyed, and the cells stop proliferating. They enter a differentiated stage that no longer divides, and over 5-8 days, migrate up to the surface of the colon, then die.
What Goes Wrong?

We know now that colon polyps form when this system fails.

Individuals with FAP have a mutation in one copy of their APC gene; inactivation of the second copy removes the growth suppression effect, and the cells continue to proliferate even after they move up the crypt wall. Near the surface they stop moving, and simply keep dividing. This forms a single polyp. Repeat the process thousands of times, and it creates the polyp-covered surface shown at the top of the page.

Individuals who have not inherited a mutation in APC still may develop inactivating mutations in both copies of the APC gene in a small number of crypt stem cells. These cells proliferate and form polyps, though not nearly as many as in FAP carriers.

The polyps themselves are NOT cancers. They are masses of cells that have lost a key growth suppression pathway. They ALSO have lost normal regulation of beta-catenin, which acts as an oncogene. In short, they have two of the major hallmarks of cancer.

The polyps lie in the colon where they are exposed to high levels of bacteria, waste products of digestion, and excreted chemical wastes. Even so most polyps will not progress to overt cancer. However it is impossible to determine which polyps will undergo the additional mutations needed. This is why polyps are routinely removed and biopsied during colonoscopies. 

H2D: Loss of Heterozygosity

Heterozygosity means an organism has two different alleles for a particular gene in question. When discussing cancer, it is used more loosely, usually to mean that the patient, animal, cell, etc., has one deleterious mutant and one non-deleterious (normal) allele for a particular gene.

Heterozygosity is important when discussing inhibitory genes such as tumor suppressors because for cancer to develop, both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene must be either mutated or deleted. For most tumor suppressors, one normal functional allele is sufficient to maintain normal growth control (though there are exceptions.)

Past studies estimate the probability of a cell gaining 1 heritable mutation is 1 in 1,000,000 for each replication cycle. Without going into details, computational modeling suggests that the probability of a cell undergoing the 3 heritable mutations needed for tumor cells (1 for an oncogene, plus 2 for the two tumor suppressor alleles) is 1/10-20. It is estimated a cell would need to undergo 200+ rounds of mitosis to produce a single transformed cell. However, human cells only can undergo 60-70 rounds of replication before they reach Hayflick limit and senesce.

For human cells to transform and become tumor cells, there must be a mechanism that inactivate both alleles of a tumor suppressor gene more rapidly than random mutation alone.

We know now that there are multiple mechanisms by which tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated.  The following sections briefly outlines several of these mechanisms.
Inherited Mutations

A person can inherit one mutant copy of a tumor suppressor gene. Familial susceptibility was discussed in detail for both retinoblastoma / Rb and FAP / APC. These individual carry a mutant allele for a tumor suppressor gene in every cell of their body, rather than in a single cell, greatly raising the probability of mutation in the second allele.
X-inactivation & Hemizygosity

Several tumor suppressor genes are located on the X chromosome, including:

WTX ,  associated with Wilm’s tumor (most common pediatric renal cancer.)
Ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (linked with ovarian cancer.)
Androgen receptor (associated with prostate cancer.)
BEX1, LDOC1, FoxP3, TSPX 

In females, one of the two X chromosomes will be inactivated at random in their cells. Since it is a “random” event, the chromosome that has a mutant copy may or may not be the one that becomes inactivated. If a woman is heterozygous for an X-linked TSG, ~50% of her cells will inactivate the X-chromosome carrying the wild type allele, leaving only the X-chromosome with a mutant allele.

Males face a different problem. They are genotype XY, and do not inactivate their X-chromosome. However the Y-chromosome is not homologous with the X- chromosome. Males that ;  chromosome with the wild type all
Haploinsufficiency

There is limited evidence to date, but it appears that some TSGs are not expressed at sufficiently high levels from a single normal allele; two functional alleles are needed. The only confirmed example of haploinsufficiency in humans is p53, which we will explore in depth later.  While not yet confirmed in humans, PTEN exhibits haploinsufficiency in mice.

An intriguing related hypothesis is that individual TSGs do NOT show obvious haplo-insufficiency, but DO reduce growth control slightly; in other words they cause “micro-insufficiencies.” It is still unknown whether multiple small insufficiencies can collectively create a large aggregate advantage.

In 2012, one study suggested that loss of large regions of chromosomes as a result of DNA damage may accelerate tumor growth by create micro-insufficiencies that collectively produce a growth advantage. To read the article, go here:
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6090/47.full
Epigenetic Methylation

Mutations are not the only way to inactivate tumor suppressors. Cells routinely silence genes by methylating the promoter regions. Abnormal methylation can silence both alleles of a tumor suppressor.  For example, RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor linked to cervical cancer that is silenced by hypermethylation of its gene by the methylase DNMT1.

There also is ample evidence indicating that HYPO-methylation of genes that should be inactive (particularly genes linked to growth during early development) also contribute to cancer growth.

While this is a relatively new branch of research, it is now clear that changes in methylation patterns are as important as sequence mutations in driving cancers.


The below table shows common tumors for which we have solid evidence of tumor suppressor inactivation by promoter hyper-methylation.



Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events

Researchers working with Rb and other tumor suppressors have documented increased rates of mutation in these genes that cannot be explained by random mutations. Very often the mutations in two homologous tumor suppressor genes will be nearly identical. Multiple mechanisms for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events have been identified. Each of these mechanisms copies a mutation in one tumor suppressor gene to the non-mutated homologous chromosome, causing loss of heterozygosity.

Three common LOH mechanisms are described briefly below.
Mitotic Recombination
For yeas it was assumed that recombination only occurred during meiosis, but now researchers have found that it can also occur during mitosis. So, if this occurs with a copy of a mutated tumor suppressor gene, then at the end of mitosis the person would be left with 2 copies of the mutant gene. In any given cell, there is about a 10-5 chance that this occurs successfully.
Non-Disjunction

Non-disjunction occurs during mitosis, when sister chromatids fail to become separated during anaphase. Because of this, one daughter cell is triploid for one chromosome, while the other daughter cell lacks that chromosome entirely. Typically, trisomy is fatal to the cell (with some exceptions, mainly Trisomy 21 and Trisomy X). However, if a cell survives long enough, it may eliminate the third chromosome. If the eliminated chromosome has the normal allele, the cell now has duplicate copies of the mutant allele.
Gene Conversion
During S phase of the cell cycle, DNA is replicated to prepare for mitosis. During replication, DNA polymerase complexes can move back and forth between two homologous chromosome strands. The reasons behind this process are unclear. Logic suggests it is a mechanism to prevent or limit DNA mutations. However, depending on where DNA polymerase switches strands, a mutant gene may be replicated to the wild type chromosome.

While we do not know precisely why gene conversion occurs, we do know that it contributes measurably to LOH events.

What Is the Prostate?
The prostate gland is a secondary sex organ in males. It surrounds the urethra, and is located just outside the bladder. It secretes a slightly alkaline, sugars-rich fluid (~30% of the volume of semen) that helps neutralize acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging sperm lifespan.


The gland consists of secretory epithelium made up of pseudostratified tall columnar cells + basal cells. This secretory layer is supported by fibroelastic stroma with some randomly oriented smooth muscle. The left half of the panel below shows normal prostate tissue. The open spaces are channels that are surrounded by the secretory epithelium. The concentrically ringed masses in the channels at the center are accumulated secretions, and are the cause of benign prostatic hypertrophy. While uncomfortable, the benign masses do not pose a cancer risk. The right panel shows a section of prostate with early stage cancer cells. The channels have been obliterated and the dark-staining nuclei of prostatic cells are now crowded together (upper right corner.)

Prostate tumors at this stage have yet to metastasize to other locations, and may not do so for decades.
The Androgen Receptor
The androgen receptor (AR) is a nucleo-cytoplasmic complex that contains the receptor protein itself plus multiple regulatory partners, the most important being the Hsps. When testosterone (T) enters cell, 5-a-reductase converts to DHT (dihydrotestone) that binds to AR. A conformation change makes AR: 1) release silencing HSPs, and 2) phosphorylate on a specific amino acid. Activated AR moves from cytoplasm to nucleus, where it binds to steroid response elements (SREs) in the promoters of AR-sensitive genes.
Androgen receptor (AR) gene is located on on X chromosome (Xq11-12). Schematic of androgen activation path. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_androgen_receptor_and_androgen_binding.svg


Normal prostate epithelium (and therefore prostate tumor cells) has a complex regulatory relationship to androgens. In normal prostate, androgens and the AR pathway mainly act as growth factors that cause prostate epithelium to proliferate.

In early stages of prostate cancer (PrC), androgens drive cell proliferation much like other oncogenes. ARs are still present but are sensitive to receptor inhibition. At this stage, tumor cell growth can be blocked for many years by " first-line" androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Typically, first-line ADT includes:

Luteinizing Hormone/GnRH agonists (leuprolide, goserelin & related) 
Milder anti-androgens (flutamide & related compounds)


Over time, a new population of tumor cells emerges in the prostate that are not fully growth- inhibited by front-line ADT. These cells appear to be responding to new sources of androgens, possibly made by the tumor itself. At this stage, the prostate cancer cells are said to be "castration-resistant," because the tumor still NEEDs androgens, but it can provide its own androgens rather than requiring androgens from the testes. At this stage, the tumors are re-classified as "castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC.)

After front-line ADT fails, the next stage of ADT therapy (A+E) uses:

Abiraterone, which suppresses androgen SYNTHESIS
Enzalutamide , which antagonizes androgen RECEPTORS

These are the strongest AR inhibitors currently approved for treatment.

Eventually, strong negative selection leads to prostate tumor cells that are resistant to A+E therapy, and are classified as AER. At this stage the cancer will be minimally affected by AR inhibition, and radical surgery and radiation therapy become the standard treatments. Once AER cells appear, prostate cancer is much more likely to metastasize to bone, brain, and other locations.
Background For This Particular Study
The central questions of this study are:

WHY does prostate cancer become castration resistant?
WHY does CR-PC progress to AER-PC?

Possible causes include:

Amplification of androgen RECEPTOR gene
Appearance of an androgen RECEPTOR splice alternative that is either:
Resistant to receptor inhibitor drugs, OR
Constitutively active (even when there is no androgen present)
Over-activation of the androgen SYNTHESIS pathway
Tumor cells go around the whole AR regulatory system, and use a different pathway to drive proliferation.

The goal of this study was to use a xenograft model of A+E resistant prostate cancer to determine which of these possible mechanisms is most likely.
Methods Used
VCaP cells
The main cell line used in most of the studies. Human prostate cancer cells harvested at autopsy from a metastatic lesion of a 59 year old Caucasian male with hormone refractory prostate cancer in 1997. Cells were xenografted from the tumor into SCID mice initially then later propagated as an immortalized prostate cancer cell line. VCaP are adherent, epithelial cells with high androgen receptor and prostate specific antigen expression. VCaP are the only prostate cancer cells that express both the AR-V7 androgen receptor splice variant,  and the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion.

LNCaP cells
Used for a small number of studies on DPP-4 inhibition. Androgen-sensitive, PTEN mutant human prostate adenocarcinoma cells derived from the left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis from a 50-year-old Caucasian male in 1977. They are adherent epithelial cells.

BID-PC-1 cells
Also used for a small number of studies on DPP-4 inhibition. Cell line derived at authors’ institution from a patient with castration resistant prostate cancer. It has a BRCA2 mutation. Unlike source tumor, this cell line is very castration sensitive, and xenograft tumors do not reappear after castration.

Matrigel
Trade name for a gelatinous protein mixture secreted by Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells. Matrigel consists of a variety of ECM molecules, and is commonly as a cell culture substrate when the local environmental signals are critical for normal cell behavior. Cells cultured on Matrigel demonstrate complex cellular behavior that is otherwise difficult to observe under laboratory conditions.

Abiraterone and Enzalutamide
Anti-androgens, that act as antagonists of the androgen receptor. They block effects of biological androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone on target tissues. High doses are used as a chemical form of castration.

Sitagliptin
Oral antihyperglycemic (antidiabetic drug) that inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4.) It is used to treat Type II diabetes.
Primary Model
Genotype-validated VCaP tumor cells were grown in tissue culture, suspended in Matrigel, then xenografted into male SCID mice (top left panel below) by injection into the tail vein (top right below). Animals were housed until tumor masses reached 1000mm3 in size (bottom panel below shows nude rats from a different study, and image is meant only to demonstrate how mice from this study might have looked once tumors had formed). Then mice were castrated.


Immediately after mice were castrated, tumors shrank then began to grow again, indicating that castration-resistant cells were present. Animals at this stage were classified as CRPR.
When a CRPR animal's re-growing tumor reached 150% of it's smallest volume, the animal was started on A+E therapy. Once again animals' tumors shrank, rebounded, then stabilized for several days. After the stable phase, tumors began growing again despite treatment with A+E. At this point, tumors were classified as A+E resistant (AER).

Tissue samples were collected from primary tumors, from CRPR animals, and from AER animals.
Additional Models
To assess whether results from VCaP tumor xenografts corresponded with changes in humans, paraffin embedded samples of patient tumors were obtained from local patients or a national tissue repository.
Analysis Methods
Quantitative RT-PCR: used to measure levels of mRNA present for individual genes.

RNA Sequencing: used to measure relative levels of mRNAs present for groups of genes.

Immunohistochemistry: used to determine overall protein levels, distributions in VCaP and human biopsy samples.

siRNA, lncRNA knockdowns:  used to determine whether knockdown of key genes could alter downstream gene expression. Note: data limited to supplemental figures only.

Bisulfite sequencing: used to determine whether the promoter of DPP-4 was inactivated by methylation. Data were limited to supplemental figures only.
Results and Discussion
First Key Finding
It was already established for this animal model that initially ADT-sensitive VCaP cells eventually develop into castration-resistant, then A+E-resistant xenograft tumors. The authors asked whether AR and related genes were being expressed at different tumor development stages. Panel A (left) in the figure below shows relative quantities (RQ) of specific mRNAs in tumor tissues.

Very little AR mRNA is produced by tumors from pre-castration mice, but AR mRNAs are produced at high levels in both castration-resistant (CRPC) and A+E-resistant (AER) prostate tumors.

Castration-resistant and A+E-resistant tumors also contain:

High levels of mRNAs for AR-V7, a constitutively active alternatively spliced AR.
High levels of mRNAs for prostate-specific antigen and NKX3.1. These are both genes that are activated in actively growing prostate epithelium.


Panel B above shows the relative mRNA production of 266 genes. The same gene is present in each row; green indicates mRNA is elevated for that gene, red indicates mRNA is lower for that gene. From the data panel, it is clear that most genes that are more active prior to castration are down-regulated as cells move to castration-resistant and A+E-resistant stages. Other genes that are downregulated in early tumores are activated in later stages.

The authors used RNA-sequencing to evaluate the RELATIVE concentration of mRNAs from genes that are activated by androgen receptors (figure below, left half). They compared expression between tumor biopsies from pre-castration (PreCx), post-castration (CRPC), and A+E resistant (AER) mice, and found that in BOTH CRPC and AER tumors, transcription of AR-dependent genes was only reduced by 8% compared to pre-castration tumors.

If they looked at RNA expression in tissues from human databases (figure above, right half), they found that AR-dependent gene expression went down 12-57% in metastatic, castration insensitive human tumors (SU 2C thru NPEC-T/CB) compared to primary prostate tumors (TCGA group).

The study authors confirmed that the mRNA levels measured by qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq matched protein levels in tissues (panel C below). Prior to castration, VCaP tumor biopsies expressed high levels of androgen receptor. AR was still present in CRPC and AER, indicating that even strong inhibition of testosterone and its receptor by A+E failed to completely shut down receptor expression.

A+E also failed to knock out AR signaling. Phosphorylation of serine 81 on AR is required for signaling; the the third column below shows that Ser81 phosphorylation still occurred even in AER tumors, meaning AR signaling is still occurring.

As tumors progressed toward greater resistance, they also began expressing the AR-V7 splice variant. Unlike normal AR, AR-V7 is constitutively active; it no longer requires androgen to activate the receptor.
From these results the authors concluded:

AR-dependent genes are still active even after castration or A+E treatment.
As prostate cancer progresses,tumor cells begin to:
Express AR signaling receptors that can activate independently of androgen binding (AR-V7).
Send signals via AR even though the receptor is being blocked by strong receptor antagonists, and synthesis of androgens is blocked.
AR-dependent genes are being activated still, even if cells are chemically starved of androgens by physical or chemical castration.


Second Key Finding
Next the authors looked at a smaller subset of AR-dependent genes, and measured relative levels of expression in Pre-Cx, CRPC, and AER prostate biopsies.

The authors identified multiple genes that are upregulated (blue column below) and down-regulated (orange column below) in AER vs. Pre-Cx tumors.


From these lists, the authors elected to focus specifically on levels of AR (essentially confirming their previously shown data), and of DPP-4, a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell growth in response to kinase receptor ligands.

The figure below shows the relative difference in mRNA concentrations for AR and DPP-4 in the 3 tumor types (X-axes) and the p-value for the difference in levels between tumor types (Y-axes).  In both castration-resistant and A+E resistant tumors, mRNA levels of DPP-4 were ~8-fold lower than in pre-castration tumors.

The authors confirmed the mRNA levels corresponded to protein by immunostaining tissues for DPP-4 (figure below, panel B).  They also evaluated signaling steps downstream of DPP-4 to confirm that signaling activity in the DPP-4 pathway was reduced in advanced prostate tumors.
Finally, the authors cross-checked their findings from mouse xenograft tumors by immunostaining sections of primary human prostate tumors (n=35) and human CRPC tumors (n=85). Looking across multiple human samples, cells in castration-resistant tumors contained approximately 1/5th as much DPP-4 staining as cells in primary tumors.


From these results the authors concluded:

As prostate tumors progress to more resistant stages, they begin expressing less DPP-4.
Loss of DPP-4 expression and protein synthesis occurs before the tumors progress to their most advanced stage.
Normally, DPP-4 synthesis is activated by AR. Given the pattern shown, and that AR signaling is still active, DPP-4 must be inactivated by a separate pathway from AR.


Third Key Finding
Finally, the authors assessed whether inactivation of DPP-4 might play a role in progression of prostate tumors from less aggressive to more aggressively growing stages.

They generated xenograft tumors using VCaP cells as before, but this time gave mice sitagliptin in drinking water starting immediately after castration. Sitagliptin is a widely prescribed FDA-approved drug used to treat Type 2 (insulin-insensitive) diabetes. It acts by inhibiting DPP-4, the enzyme that inactivates insulin and other peptide ligands for kinase receptors.

Mice given sitagliptin developed larger tumors than mice given water only (figure below). By 32 days post-castration, tumor volume was significantly larger in animals treated with sitagliptin than in controls given water only.


The effects of DPP-4 inhibition were not unique to VCaP cells. The authors showed similar increase in tumor mass for xenografts made with two other independent prostate tumor cell lines (LNCaP, figure below, top panel, and BID-PC-1, bottom panel). The appearance of castration resistant tumors for BID-PC-1 xenografts is significant because under normal conditions, xenograft tumors of this cell line regress completely after castration, suggesting that loss of DPP-4 may enable tumor growth independently of AR signaling.


From these results the authors concluded:

Loss of DPP-4 may be one of the mechanisms that stimulates prostate tumor cells to grow in an androgen-independent manner.

Implications of This Study to Cancer Biology
Normally, DPP-4 gene expression is STIMULATED by the androgen receptor. Yet in prostate tumor, it appears that DPP-4 gene expression is NOT activated by the AR signaling pathway.

The authors did not break down the details of the signaling error, but it is fairly clear that:

DPP-4 protein and activity declines EARLY in prostate cancer progression.
The DPP-4 gene has not been inactivated permanently.
Could stimulate DPP-4 gen expression in VCaP and LNCaP cells with androgen.
Could block DPP-4 gene expression with enzalutamide.
DPP-4 gene is NOT permanently silenced by epigenetic methylation. (Their data are weak on this claim, and limited to the supplemental results only. )
Something about the tumor environment is knocking down DPP4 in both of the androgen-insensitive forms of prostate cancer.

We know from other work that DPP-4 is a growth factor silencing protein.

Under NORMAL cell conditions, DPP-4 cleaves dipeptides from peptide mitogens like EGF, insulin, FGF, or PDGF.
Prostate tumor lysates had elevated mitogen signaling thru PI3K, Erk-MAPK, p38-JNK paths. This suggests something in their inactivation pathways is missing. 

If loss of DPP-4 allows mitogens to stimulate cells for longer, then DPP-4 can be classified as a tumor suppressor gene. Unfortunately, DPP-4 inhibitors are widely administered to older adults to help control insulin-insensitive Type II diabetes. These medications may be a confounding factor that accelerates progression of castration-sensitive prostate cancer to a less androgen-dependent or even androgen-insensitive stage.
Limitations, Problems With This Study
The largest question in my mind is, did they miss other potentially more important genes? I am speculating here, but DPP-4 seems like the odd protein of the bunch.

Looking at the list of up- and down-regulated genes more closely, I found 3 of the up-regulated genes and 2 of the down-regulated genes are linked to neuronal cell growth. The prostate gland has minimal neuronal tissue; so why are the tumor cells altering neuronal signaling pathways?

Up-regulated 4-6-fold

TMEFF2. An EGF-like trans-membrane protein linked to cell proliferation.
OR51E1. A prostate-specific G protein coupled receptor.
BHLHE41. Basic HLH transcription factor E41. This is a central transcription factor for regulating growth.
NOV. An olfactory neuron growth regulator.
SCG2. Secretogranin II, found in endocrine cells and neurons
FOLH1. A prostate-specific membrane antigen; req'd for folate metabolism, so is essential for cell growth. Especially important for neuronal cell development.

Down-regulate 5-7-fold

FAM189A2. A gonad-specific regulator gene. Loss is linked to gonadal dysgenesis.
SH3RF2. Ring finger protein that regulates PP1 phosphatase. PP1 is the central phosphatase for turning off signaling paths. Like cdks that need cyclin for specificity, PP1 must partner with other proteins to find specific substrates.
CACNG4. A gene expressed by neuronal nuclei, and required for normal neuronal cell development.
VSTM2A. A gene required for neuronal cell survival.



The other question I have is, what regulates DPP-4 normally? If I had been a reviewer, I would have asked them to at least speculate on why it was inactivated; clearly epigenetic regulation is not what is going on.

H3. Genome Instability
Overview: Genome Instability

H3: Overview
H3A: Cell Proliferation & Differentiation
H3B: DNA Damage
H3C: DNA Repair
H3D: Journal Article

So far we have seen that cancer cells need to both acquire an oncogene and lose tumor suppressor function. But what is happening in the genome to drive these events?

This hallmark explores the necessary events that occur in the genome--to the DNA itself--that lead to these changes.



The Myth of Genome Stability

Genomes are not stable, even in normal, healthy cells. 

1) DNA can be modified, reprogrammed, and reorganized. 

DNA organization is constantly shifting. For example, DNA can be wrapped as heterochromatin (DNA tightly wrapped around the histones and its expression suppressed) or as euchromatin (DNA loosely wrapped around the histones and is more accessible/more likely to be expressed).
Loss of heterozygosity events (explored in Hallmark 2) are not unique to cancer cells. This demonstrates changes in DNA of healthy cells. 
Methylation and acetylation additionally contributes to changes in DNA expression in normal, healthy cells.


2) Mutations and rearrangements are common.

Mutations--explored more in depth in a subsequent page--are very common and usually does not lead to cancer. The cell has many mechanisms of repair. 


Not all cells or sites, however, are equally unstable or at risk of mutation.

On the cellular level: Cells that divide more quickly are more prone to having DNA damage. Because they have a fast reproduction rate, they are most likely to acquire a mutation and propagate it. 

Figure illustrates chromosomes with higher susceptibility to damage

On the genomic level: This picture above shows the percentage of tumors with an allele deletion on a specific chromosome. From the graph, we can see that some chromosomes are more susceptible to allele deletions that lead to cancer than others. Compare chromosomes 17 and 18 to chromosome 2 and 20, for example. 


Figure illustrates how different regions of a gene are more susceptible than others to mutation

On the single gene level: This image above illustrates different mutations at different points on the BRCA2 and BRCA1 genes that lead to cancer. We can see that some parts of the gene are much more susceptible to mutations than others.


Many cells do well, despite this damage. 
Some cells, like liver cells, intentionally have aneuploidy, or no consistent number of sets of chromosomes. This prevents cells constantly exposed to toxins (cells likely to have extensive DNA damage) from replicating. 

The good news: cells have many repair mechanisms--as you will see in subsequent pages--to repair mistakes in the genome. Damage to these mechanisms, however, is a critical disruption that can lead to cancer. Without mechanisms to repair DNA damage, it gets passed on to new daughter cells. 

Connections:

Checkpoints in Replication Cycle Relate to DNA Repair Mechanisms
Pages H3B and H3C discuss how DNA damage occurs and how the cells' repair mechanisms fix it. Hallmark 2's page H2B explores how dividing cells stall replication and the cell cycle if there is DNA damage.
The Cellular Choice for Repair or Apoptosis 
H3C discusses DNA repair mechanisms, but should the cell bother to actually repair it? Visit Hallmark 4's page, H4A, to learn about how the cell decides if it should arrest the cell cycle (to repair the damage)  or "give up" all together and undergo apoptosis. What happens if the DNA damage cannot be fixed? To learn more about how a cell commits to apoptosis, visit Hallmark 4's page on the mechanisms of apoptosis, H4B. 
Gene Amplification Behavior Mirrors that of an Oncogene
The Journal Article (H3D) explores the effects of whole genome duplication (WGD), but the article does not explore the idea that WGD itself could act as an oncogene. Hallmark 1's page, H1D, explains how gene amplification can act like an oncogene. 
Cell Cycle Abnormalities as a Result of Mutated Regulator Protein
This hallmark discusses genome instability resulting from various kinds of DNA damage. Visit page H5B to see how DNA damage and p53 activation interplay to control/halt the progression of the cell cycle.
Immortilization Caused by Faulty Repair Mechanisms and Mutations in hTERT
DNA damage can result in the loss of telomeres. Hallmark 5 discusses the normal loss of telomeres by DNA damage and how immortalization occurs.
Loss of Apoptosis Results from Mutations within the Genome
DNA damage can signal p53 to induce apoptosis. Visit H7D to see how signaling p53 from DNA damage can also alter metabolic pathways. 
Metabolic Dysfunction as It Relates to Genomic Instability
DNA lesions within metabolic oncogenes that are not adequately repaired before they are incorporated into the genome can lead to shifts in cellular metabolic function. This can include mutations in p53 that damage the cell's ability to inhibit glycolysis and up-regulate oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, oncogenic change in any number of proteins related to glutamine metabolism can trigger an increase in amino acid metabolism.  Defects in the cells DNA damage machinery make the preceding metabolic transformations more likely to occur.  
The Impact of DNA Damage on Immune Dysfunction
DNA damage that was not repaired could ultimately impact protein expression related to the immune response. Repression of phagocytosis could be acheived by a mutation that results in over-expression of CD47. Mutations of B7 could prevent binding to CD28 of T cells, preventing T cell activation. The ability to detect and prevent DNA damage from causing these defects provides ample connection between immune dysfunction and DNA Damage repair. 

H3A: Proliferation & Differentiation
Cells Must Divide and Differentiate

To further understand why some cells are more at risk for cancer than others, we first must understand the relationship between stem cell proliferation-differentiation and genomic stability.  

Every person begins as a single-cell zygote. The zygote is totipotent; it can become any cell type. As the single cell develops into an embryo, some cells remain stem cells while others differentiate. Stem cells in the body, however, are pluripotent; they are capable of becoming only a narrow range of cells. Hemoblasts, for example, are stem cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all the blood cells. 

Stem cells, like hemoblasts, reproduce very slowly while they wait for a signal to divide more quickly. Once the stem cell receives this signal, it is committed to transforming and differentiating into a specific cell type. The stem cell produces two daughter cells: one remains a stem cell, the second is committed to differentiation. The cell designated to undergo the process of differentiation is referred to as a transit-amplifying cell. 

Figure illustrates stem cell reproduction
A transit-amplifying cell reproduces quickly, creating many cells that will perform a final, differentiated function. The end state of these cells is the terminally differentiated state (G0). 

Stem, Transit-Amplifying, and Differentiated State Cell Cancer Risk Assessment


As discussed in the overview page, cells that divide quickly are most prone to developing cancer because 1) they are more likely to obtain a mutation during replication and 2) they are more likely to propagate the mutation to more cells. As a result, stem cells, transit-amplifying cells, and cells in a differentiated state have different risks for promoting a transformed cell population, summarized in the figure above. 

Stem Cells: These cells divide very slowly and are thus less likely to transform into cancer cells. 
Transit-Amplifying Cells: These cells have the highest risk for becoming transformed populations. They divide very quickly.
Differentiated Cells: These cells are unlikely to transform into cancer because, by definition, they do not replicate. To transform into cancer, they need to have a mutation and dedifferentiate. However, if a cell in this state has DNA damage, it is more likely to senesce or undergo apoptosis. 


Leukemia as an example:
Why does leukemia develop at certain stages of hematpoiesis? 

Figure illustrates the pathway of blood cell differentiation

Hemoblasts are blood stem cells (pluripotent). They undergo mitosis very slowly. Leukemia develops in the intermediate stages of hematpoiesis--the transit-amplifying stage--where the cells divide very rapidly but before they achieve a permanently differentiated state (G0). 


The figure above illustrates the leukemic stem cell model

The leukemic stem cell model is the current  model that explains this process. In normal hematopoiesis stem cells (HSC) have an unlimited ability to self replicate and give rise to transit-amplifying cell intermediate cells (MPP). These, again, further differentiate into more specific intermediate cells (i.e. CLP, CMP, MEP, GMP) that have lost the ability to self replicate.  These normally are limited in the number of times they can replicate. The formation of a leukemic stem cells (LSC)--which regains the ability to self-replicate many times-- in myeloid leukemia may result from mutation in cells of different stages:

A: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. The leukemic stem cell is derived from MPP.
B: Chronic and Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The leukemic stem cell is derived from GMP. This is a more differentiated cell and requires a second mutation that allows it to self-replicate more. 
C: Raises the question if differentiated blood cells can give rise to a leukemic stem cell. 
D: Illustrates that in the "pre-leukemia" stage, leukemic stem cells are genetically unstable and the ability to self-replicate leads to the acquisition of more mutations. 
E: New mutations leads to the development of different clonal populations. 


Note that the abbreviations are only to provide reference to the image.  

So: this shows that the transent-amplifying cells are most likely to gain the mutation to lead to leukemia while the hemoblast and differentiated cells do not. If the cancer arises from a more differentiated cell (B), it needs to re-acquire self-replication.

 H3B: DNA Damage

DNA damage is a diverse topic involving many different macro-level and chemical processes. This page will progress from whole genome damage toward chemical conversion of a single base. The hope is that such an approach will illustrate the wide array of causes associated with genomic instability, mutagenesis, and subsequent tumorigenesis. 



Whole Genome 

The architecture of a cell’s genome is particularly vulnerable during replication, at which time the entirety of the cell’s genetic information is duplicated and distributed amongst daughter cell progeny. There are three common methods by which the genome can be damaged during this time.

Mitotic Recombination in Heterozygous Cells:

This event occurs after S phase and is defined as the exchange of one duplicated mutant chromatid arm with a duplicated nonmutant chromatid arm. This leads to the presence of a mutation for a given tumor suppressor gene in both chromosomes. Segregation allows for the possibility that 50% of daughter cells will lose heterozygosity and become homozygous for the mutant tumor suppressor gene.




Non-Disjunction in Heterozygous Cells:

The inability of a cell to segregate chromatids equally results in a trisomy event. When the genetic instability that comes from such an occurrence is remediated through the destruction of the extra chromatid, the end genetic complement may be homozygous for a mutant form of TSG.



Gene Conversion in Heterozygous Cells:

This type of event happens when DNA polymerase begins replication on a given chromosome but then transitions to a neighboring template strand of the homologous chromosome. This leaves a section of mRNA that codes for the mutant form of TSG. 



Epigenetic Factors:

Additionally, there are epigenetic factors that can silence a tumor suppressor gene (HDAC over-expression and Methylation) or cause additional expression of a mutant gene (HAT over-expression).



Big Picture Implications of Whole Genome Damage

The overarching implication of these forms of damage is the loss of heterozygosity. It is a possibility that a cell contains the alleles for normative TSG and that of a mutant. The presence of the wild type form is capable of sustaining normal cellular function and preventing cancerous growth.  In the event of a whole genome error, the normative allele is damaged or lost, leaving the cell with only the defective TSG allele. As a result, normal cellular function is lost and an accumulation of mutant tumor suppressor genes increases to unsustainable levels, leading to cancer. 




Strand Level Damage

Strand level damage is a category defined by the disruption of a double stranded polymer of DNA during replication. This is due in large part to the fragility of the template strand during replication. A phosphodiester bond of the template strand is cleaved, causing the preceding double stranded DNA to brake away. Errors in replication resulting in the addition of the wrong base are also sources of genomic instability.




Exogenous Damage

This form of damage originates from external sources such as environmental radiation, combustion products, and other chemicals.

Intercalators such as thalidomide disrupt the DNA double helix.

UV radiation can cause dimerization of thymidine and the formation of stable cyclobutene bridges.





Additionally, alkylating agents (1) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (2) cause DNA lesions.

Endogenous Damage

These are chemical changes that occur with regularity within the bases of DNA. Depurination is the loss of purine bases via hydrolysis. Deamination and Oxidation Events chemically alter the structure of the bases themselves.

H3C: DNA Repair
Repair Mechanisms for DNA Damage

Table 1. Types of DNA Damage and Corresponding Repair Mechanisms

Base Excision Repair (BER)

Figure 1. Base excision repair mechanism. 

This repair mechanism is activated when individual bases change. 
Mechanism: 
First,  an enzyme involved in the repair pathway called glycosylase removes the damaged nitrogenous base by flipping the damaged base out of the helix and cleaving its N-glycosidic bond, leaving the sugar-phosphate backbone intact. This creates an abasic site. 
Next, an endonuclease (an enzyme that cleaves phosphodiester bonds) acts at the site of damage. Specifically, the AP endonuclease is used in repair mechanisms. The ribose sugar and phosphate are removed. 
Lastly, ligase patches the break by creating a phosphodiester bond. 


Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)

Figure 2. Nucleotide excision repair mechanism. 

This repair mechanism is activated by DNA damage such as dimers and adducts caused by intercalators and radiation, specifically UV. 
Mechanism:
Radiation exposure creates bulky adducts (e.g. thymine dimers) that attract binding proteins. 
Next, a short single-stranded DNA segment containing the lesion is removed. 
DNA polymerase uses the undamaged segment as a template for the damaged segment.  
Finally, DNA ligase seals, finalizing the repair. 
2 possible pathways: 
Global-genomic NER (GG-NER)
Transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER)


Figure 3. Two possible pathways of nucleotide excision repair mechanism. These pathways differ in the ways they recognize DNA damage, but converge in repairing and ligating. 

A genetic variation or mutation in this pathway can increase the likelihood of developing cancer. For instance, in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a homozygous deficiency in the UV DNA damage repair pathway (TC-NER) causes symptoms such as sunburn, blisters, numerous freckles, keratomas (benign tumors of keratin cells), sensitive eyes that may become irritated or bloodshot when exposed to sunlight, scaly skin, irregular dark spots, and corneal ulcers. 
Research of XP has been integral in the discovery of two proteins in the NER pathway: XPC and XPD


Mismatch Repair (MMR)

This repair mechanism, which recognizes and repairs errors in insertion, deletion, or mis-incorporation of bases, occurs immediately post-synthesis. In this mechanism, 1 in every 10^2 base errors are missed. When combined with immediate polymerase complex self-correction, this limits missed base errors to 1 in every 10^9 bases. 
This mechanism is strand-specific, meaning it recognizes the new strand separately from that of the parent. 
In prokaryotes, this recognition occurs due to differences in methylation. 
In eukaryotes, this recognition mechanism is still unclear but may be a cause of nicks in the lagging strand. 

Table 2. Proteins Associated with MMR Mechanism

Homology-Directed End Repair (HDR) 

Figure 4. HDR mechanism for double-stranded breaks. 

In this type of repair, double-stranded DNA lesions are repaired using sister chromatids, or a homologous piece of DNA present in the nucleus. 
Mechanism:
One strand creates a single-stranded overhang that is then base paired to the homologous chromosome. 
The overhand is then extended and disengaged from its sister and used as a template.
BRCA-1,2: act as scaffolds for proteins in stabilization, resection, Rad51-mediated invasion into homologous chromatid; act similarly to tumor suppressors
ATM/ATR: kinases that mediate signaling
ATM: recruited and activated by double-stranded breaks, phosphorylates proteins that activate DNA damage checkpoint leading to cell cycle arrest 
targets include TSG's such as p53
mutation can result in ataxia telangiectasia (see Table 3)
ATR: recruited and activated by stresses such as radiation, phosphorylates targets involved in cell cycle regulation
targets include BRCA1, p53


Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)
Figure 5. NHEJ mechanism for double-stranded breaks. 

This repair mechanism is similar to the previous HDR; however, this repair is not as effective because no scaffold or templates are present. Instead, broken ends are directly ligated without a homologous template. Microhomologies, or short homologous DNA sequences usually consisting of single-stranded overhangs, are used. 


What happens when these repair mechanisms are mutated or absent?

The Main Takeaways:
Remember, the main points of the article are:

Whole Genome Duplication is a common event in tumors, but tetraploidy is not stable
Genomes stabilize to triploidy, creating variation in the cell populations (each experiences a different loss of heterozygosity event)
Tumors with WGD generally have a worse prognosis
TP53 mutations and wild-type P53 with G1 arrest defects essentially create an environment that is more permissive of tetraploidization
Tetraploidization is a stochastic event

Background

Within this paper, there are a few key concepts that the authors discuss to explain their results, including gene amplification and its effects on the cell as well as the functioning of p53, both normally and mutated. 

Gene amplification is the expansion in copy number of a gene within the cell's genome. This amplification can serve to activate oncogenes, as well as possibly increasing protooncogenic expression, which can select for cell growth and proliferation. Gene amplification can also cause tumor suppressor inhibition due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events. In this paper, the authors discuss whole genome duplication (WGD) or the amplification of an entire gene, creating LOH events at the chromosomal level, which can be used to explain the average ploidy count of 3.3 that was found within the cohort. 

Ploidy changes are a common mechanism for human tumorigenesis. Cancer cells are frequently growing, dividing, and accumulating mutations as they do so. Somatic human cells are typically diploid, and changes in ploidy in human cells are rare (an exception being germ cells that undergo meiosis). Because human cells are not meant to maintain increased ploidy, such as that which would result from a WGD event, the result is genomic instability that must be reconciled. 

P53, or TP53 if referring to the human isotope form, was first identified in 1979, and its normal functioning as a tumor suppressor was discovered in 1989. It can be found on the short arm of the 17th chromosome in humans, and it is commonly mutated in human cancers. 

Figure illustrates the normal p53 mechanism

Above, you will see the normal mechanism of p53. Once DNA damage has occurred (e.g. radiation damage, etc.), p53 is phosphorylated and thereby activated. The active TP53 protein binds the regulatory region of the p21 gene, which stimulates p21 protein production. P21 acts as an inhibitor for cdk2, and together the complex serves as the G1 checkpoint. Therefore, p53 serves an important role in preventing cells with damaged DNA from proceeding in the cell cycle. 

Key Goals of Paper:
1. Find and understand genomic associations (e.g. relationship between mutated p53 and WGD events)
2. Understand chronological order of tumor formation as it relates to mutation and WGD events. 
3. Understand the clinical implications of WGD events. 


Methods & Results

Methods & Results 1:

Methods: the researchers ran a facets analysis (a type of statistical analysis) on 6,184 primary tumors to estimate tumor cell ploidy and copy number variation (CNV). The goal of this method was to determine the difference between independent gene duplication events (CNV) and WGD. 

Figure 1a: illustrates frequency of tumors with a given MCN >2 and highlights point a tumor is considered to have undergone WGD

The above figure illustrates the the number of tumors with a given percentage of a person's genome with more than two mass copy numbers (MCN)
Mass Copy Number Explained: A tetraploid genome is unstable. It is more stable as a triploid genome. When the genome stabilizes from tetraploid to triploid, an allele is lost. This results in one allele being occurring twice (i.e. the one inherited from the mother) , and one occurs only once (i.e. the one inherited from the father). The result is an uneven ratio of mother inherited: father inherited alleles (2:1). The allele present in higher frequency is the mass copy number. 
If an individual has an MCN greater than or equal to 2 for more 50% of the genome, it is said this individual experienced a WGD event. If an individual has an MCN greater than or equal to 2 for less 50% of the genome,it is said this individual did not undergo WGD and the MCN can be accounted by multiple independent gene duplication events. 
The figure illustrates a bimodal distribution. This suggests that there is a strong distinction between independent gene duplication events and WGD events. 

Figure 1b: illustrates average ploidy and heterozygosity loss

Figure 1b above illustrates average tumor ploidy. It shows that if a person underwent WGD, their average ploidy state is triploid, not tetraploid. As it is explained above, tetrploid is very unstable. The shift to triploidy can be interpreted as a loss of heterozygousity. 

Figure 1c: illustrates fraction of tumors with WGD for a given cancer

Figure 1c illustrates the frequency of WGD events in specific cancers. The figure shows that WGD is common in many cancers but occurs more frequently in some over others. 



Methods & Results 2:

Methods: Essentially the researchers employed a statistical algorithm to determine if mutations occurred prior to or after WGD. If the mutations occur prior to WGD, then duplicated alleles should have the same mutation. If the mutations occur after WGD, then each duplicated allele would not express the same mutation. 

Figure 2A shows the percentage of WGD tumor cells of various tissue types with TP53 mutations

Figure 2B illustrates how many WGD cells out of a given cohort had TP53 mutations, oncogenic driver mutations, or other passenger mutations prior to duplication. The percentage of affected cases seemed to be elevated with TP53 mutations as well as with other oncogenic drivers.

Figure 2C depicts the incidence of WGD relative to certain types of TP53 mutations. There was no significant difference between the type of TP53 mutation and percentage of tumors with WGD.

Figure D depicts the degree of association between various defects and WGD. Strongest associations are further from the dotted line. (GCT = Germ cell tumor) (Seminoma = germ cell tumor in testes)


Figure E argues that there is a correlation between how fast a cell-type replicates and how probable a WGD is to occur. 



Methods & Results 3:

HR stands for the ratio of the hazard rates corresponding to the conditions described by two levels of  variable(i.e. HR of 3 is a 3X likelihood of mortality) 

Figure A shows a worse prognostic outcome for cancer patients with WGD versus those without.

Figure B depicts the prevalence of WGD in both primary and metastatic tumors of various cancer types.

Figures in C compare survival of primary pancreatic tumor patients with and without WGD. WGD patients survival is shorter. Cohorts come from both their study and an independent sample from a database. 

Figure D depicts KRAS mutation outcomes both with and without WGD.

Figure E shows a higher hazard ratio in patients with WGD than with age, MSI, or sidedness in KRAS positive colorectal cancer

Figure G depicts  the hazard ratio of WGD versus other predictive categories in hormone-receptor–positive/HER2-negative TP53-wild-type breast cancers. 

Figure F shows survival outcomes for  hormone-receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer patients with tp53 and WGD presentations.  


The big picture implication of the above figure is the increased fatality of patients with WGD in a wide array of cancer types. Additionally, WGD status is associated with an increase in mortality relative to other predictive categories. 

Discussion

This paper found that WGD events are a common deviation from healthy cells in cancer cell populations. Importantly, the results of this paper demonstrate that there is specific precursor event that leads to WGD. However, a oncogenic driver is required. The authors conclude that TP53 mutations and wild-type P53 with G1 arrest defects essentially create an environment that is more permissive of tetraploidization; tetraploidization, however, is a stochastic event. 

Understanding WGD has important implications in therapy advances. When the tetraploid genome stabilizes to a triploid genome, there is a loss of heterozygosity event. This may serve as a precursor to subclonal diversification within the tumor: cells within a single tumor are not identical. Recently, such tumor diversification studied in lung adenocarcinoma have shown poorer patient outcomes.  Additionally, WGD has generally shown poorer pan-cancer prognoses and further study may lead to more targeted treatments for this high-risk group. 

This article has left us with a few unanswered questions:

What attributes of a germline tumor make them susceptible to WGD independent of TP53 mutations?
Why does the loss of TP3 function increase the chance of WGD more than other tumor suppressors (i.e. Rb)?


H4. Loss of Apoptosis
Overview

History
The discovery of the polyomavirus SV40 and its introduction as a pathogen into the human population is tied to the distribution and development of the early forms of the polio vaccine. The inactivated and early live attenuated forms of polio were contaminated with SV40. This contamination occurred because the early vaccines were prepared in primary cultures of kidney cells derived from rhesus monkeys. These monkeys are often naturally infected with SV40.

In 1979 it was shown that the ape virus SV40 with a Large-T antigen (94 kD) is a multifunctional complex that activates many different paths in cells and immortalizes them. SV40 large-T binds to p53 in 3T3, a mouse line, and to Rb, the "universal" tumor suppressor controlling cell state. After a cell is infected, SV40 produces large and small T-antigens early in the viral replication cycle. The antigens bind and block important tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, pRb, p107, and p130/Rb2. SV40 blocks p53, which is a tumor suppressor that is believed to sense DNA damage and either pauses the cell for DNA repair or direct the cell to go through the apoptosis. 

It was the shown in radiation studies that there were high concentrations of p53 after radiation exposure and that p53 induces transcription of p21 as shown in part A of the figure below. Part B of this figure shows the survival of p53 KO cells in X-rays. The figure below that shows the survival of p53 KO mice. The conclusions from this research were that cells are more resistant to radiation when p53 is knocked out than wildtype p53 cells, because wildtype p53 kills cells when DNA is damaged. However, organisms with wildtype p53 have greater survival than p53 knockout organisms. Knockout organisms accumulate DNA damage because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis, which reduces overall survival. 
This research used a single knockout (KO) of p53, only knocking out one gene. It is also possible to do a double knockout (DKO) where two genes are knocked out at the same time. A knockout organism is, for example, a mouse that is genetically engineered to have one or more genes in their genome inoperative.

Why we care about p53:
The reason why we care so much about p53 is because up to half of tumors have a p53 mutation. p53 is a central regulator in the cell, controlling senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair.

Connections

Hallmark 1-Self Sufficient Growth

Signals for proliferation lead to p53 inactivation through increased Mdm2 activity. However, over-production of E2Fs can activate p53 by activating p14ARF as a control mechanism to control overgrowth of cells. To learn more about how oncogenes can lead to over-proliferation, see page H1D.

Hallmark 2-Loss of Growth Suppression

p53 is an important tumor suppressor in the cell, regulating the decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. For more background on tumor suppressors, see page H2A.

Rb is the “universal tumor suppressor” that controls the state of the cell. p53 works together with Rb to integrate signals coming into the cell and mediate changes within the cell. To learn more about how Rb does its job, see page H2B.

Hallmark 3-Genome Instability

Mutations in p53 and other proteins in the apoptosis pathway can allow cells with other DNA damage to avoid apoptosis. For more information on how these mutations occur, see page H3B.

P53 mediates how the cell responds to DNA damage, whether through cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or through apoptosis. To find out how DNA damage can be repaired, see page H3C. 

Hallmark 5-Immortalization

Telomeres protect the ends of DNA, but when they become too short, p53 triggers apoptosis in order to avoid further DNA damage. To learn more about the function and structure of telomeres, see page H5B.

When telomeres become too short in cells with non-functional p53, the cell enters crisis. Additionally, p53 dysfunction means that cells cannot trigger apoptosis in response to the massive genomic damage that occurs during crisis. To learn more about this process, see page H5C.

Hallmark 6-Immune Dysfunction

Natural killer cells trigger apoptosis in cells that present foreign proteins (either from infection by a pathogen or by genetic changes in cancer cells). For more information about the role of the immune system in cancer, see page H6B.

Hallmark 7-Altered Energetics

The effects of p53 are not only involved in the DNA damage response. For more information on the indirect effects of p53 on metabolism, see page H7D.

Late Stage Events

Dysfunction within the apoptotic pathway is not the only cellular change that is necessary to transform cells into cancer. Page LE1 explains some of the additional changes that are necessary to cause cancer.

Mesenchymal cells are more resistant to apoptosis than epithelial cells. To learn more about the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition that many cancer cells undergo, see page LE2.

Cells typically undergo anoikis, a variant of apoptosis, after a short time without surface support. The EMT process makes cells less susceptible to anoikis, which helps cells survive metastasis. For more information on how cells survive metastasis, see page LE4. 



H4A: Structure and Function of p53

Structure of p53

p53 acts as a homotetramer. The tetramer needs to be composed of 4 wildtype units, or it cannot function. Even one mutant unit will silence the activity of the whole tetramer. This means that, in a pool of half wildtype and half mutant p53 units, there is only a 1/16 chance that 4 wildtype units will come together to form an active p53 tetramer. This makes p53 haplo-insufficient, as only one mutated copy of the gene is necessary to reduce its function to an unsustainable level.

Effect of one mutated copy of p53 on the pool of subunits

However, the scale of the mutation also matters. Large mutations make the units unable to form tetramers at all, so these units are effectively taken out of the pool entirely. Cells in this situation can upregulate their normal copy of the p53 gene to make enough wildtype units to have a functional p53 system. Smaller mutations, however, can be tolerated and these units can join tetramers, even though these tetramers cannot function.

P53 plays a powerful regulatory role in the cell—it can bind to 300 different gene promoters. In order to fine tune its function, p53 has numerous modification sites (shown below) for methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and other modifications. Modifications are controlled by signals within the cell, and the modification pattern controls p53’s binding partners and its stability by altering the availability of ubiquitination sites.
Possible modification sites on p53

Regulation of p53 Levels
P53 is always being made in the cell, but with a half-life of around 15 minutes, it is also always being degraded. In a normal cell state, its levels are controlled by Mdm2. P53 has a very high affinity for the Mdm2 promoter. Once it is translated, Mdm2 binds to p53 and adds a ubiquitin to it, marking it for destruction in the proteasome. P53 levels are altered when the cell receives signals that cause it to leave its normal state.
Mdm2 regulation of p53


Proliferation Signals: When the cell receives signals to proliferate, p53 levels are decreased. This is achieved through Mdm2 regulation. Mdm2 synthesis is increased directly by proliferation signaling. Mdm2 is also stabilized by phosphorylation. This leads to more ubiquitination of p53 by Mdm2, lowering levels of p53 in the cell.

DNA Damage Signals: When DNA damage is sensed within the cell, p53 activity increases. ATM and ATR, proteins that sense DNA damage, directly phosphorylate p53, stabilizing it. These kinases also perform destabilizing phosphorylation on Mdm2 and activate p14ARF, which acts as an Mdm2 antagonist. p14ARF binds to Mdm2, freeing p53 to perform its role in regulating the cell cycle. Interestingly, E2Fs also activate p14ARF production, even though E2Fs are growth signals. E2Fs do this as a negative feedback mechanism, making sure that cell growth does not get out of control. As shown in the figure below, p53 is activated in response to things such as DNA damage, oncogene activation, and other cell stressors.
Signals that lead to the activation of p53

P53 activation can occur at a variety of times during the cell cycle. The yellow arrows in the figure below show times where p53 activity can be increased. P53 activation can occur during G0 or G1 if there is damage, during S phase if replication is not completed properly, or during G2 or M phase if the cell is not properly prepared for division.
Periods of p53 activation in the cell cycle

Arrest or Apoptosis
Possible downstream effects of p53 activation

Once activated, p53 plays a role in various responses to stress, including cell cycle arrest for DNA repair or apoptosis, as shown in the figure above. P53 must integrate all of the signals that it is receiving in order to decide whether the cell will arrest the cell cycle or undergo apoptosis. This decision is very important because these two processes occur via very different mechanisms. To pause the cell cycle, p21Cip1 is increased to block the cell cycle directly, transcription of cyclins E, A, and B is blocked, and synthesis of DNA repair machinery is increased. Triggering apoptosis acts through mitochondrial changes, beginning with a shift in the Bcl2/Bax ratio (which controls the opening of mitochondrial pores) and ending with the activation of a death cascade within the cell. Clearly, it is important that p53 triggers the correct pathway to respond to the stress that the cell is facing.

The decision between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is dependent on the levels of other proteins, specifically Myc, and on time. Myc is a growth signal that competes with p53 for a site on the promoter of p21. When levels of Myc and p53 are low, the cell is not sensing growth or damage signals, so p21 levels remain low and the cell favors a quiescent state. When levels of p53 are high and levels of Myc remain low, p21 levels increase, causing cell cycle arrest. Increased p53 signals DNA damage, so the cell arrests to fix this damage before continuing. If levels of p53 and Myc are both increased, p21 levels remain low and apoptosis is triggered by activating apoptosis stimulating proteins of p53 family (ASPPs). This mixed signal between Myc (growth) and p53 (damage) leads the cell to favor apoptosis so that it does not replicate in its damaged state. These two pathways are shown in the figure below.
Two possible pathways in response to increased levels of p53
The other factor affecting the cell cycle arrest or apoptosis decision is timing. The first transcriptional targets of p53 all favor cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair. When p53 remains active for a longer period of time, it begins to activate the proteins necessary for apoptosis. These early and late transcriptional targets are shown in the figure below.

H4B: Apoptosis
Visualizing and Understanding Apoptosis: 
It is necessary to realize where the process of Apoptosis comes into play. Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of cell death that not only plays a role in developmental morphogenesis, but also controls cell numbers and gets rid of damaged cells. It is a crucial tumor suppression mechanism within the body, because it gets rid of cells that have extensive DNA damage and the potential to lead to cancer.The saying “Out of sight out of Mind” is true in terms of apoptosis because many are blind to the necessity of this cellular process to our continued survival due to the fact that it happens at the cellular level. In fact an every day physiological example of apoptosis is when your skin peels after a sunburn. This is one way in which our cells use apoptosis to fight against skin cancer after they have extensive DNA damage due to UV exposure. 

Normal use of apoptosis after DNA damage due to sunburn

Not only is this cellular process already ingrained into our body’s everyday function, but it is also the goal of many conventional cancer treatments as they strive to induce apoptosis within cancerous cells.The apoptotic process is very tidy, and leaves behind little to no evidence of the pre-existing cell’s presence. The cell undergoing apoptosis is swept clean during phagocytosis by macrophages and neighboring cells that respond to the molecular flags raised by apoptosing cells. 
Overview of the apoptosis process

Caspases: Function and Purpose in Apoptosis:  
Caspases, a specific group of proteases, play a central role in apoptosis helping to breakdown the cellular components that make this such a neat disposal process. They aide in the shrinkage of the nucleus allowing for the degradation of the protein network of lamins that underlie the structure of the nuclear envelope. 
Initially, cells may be induced to undergo apoptosis by extracellular signals called “death factors”, or by internal physical or chemical insults such as DNA damage or oxidative stress. This leads to the activation of one of two non-exclusive molecular pathways, the extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway, and caspases are central in both. Caspases are initially inactive enzymes called procaspases that need to be cleaved at aspartate residues in order to be activated. As caspases become activated, they participate in a caspase cascade of activation whereby one caspase can activate another caspase in a chain reaction. This caspase cascade leads to the amplification of an apoptotic signal in a cell.  

Overview of the caspase cascade that causes apoptosis

Extrinsic and Intrinsic Apoptosis:
Extrinsic Pathway- Similar to the way the cell triggers growth, the extrinsic pathway starts with a death factor being received by a transmembrane death receptor. The death receptors include Fas receptors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. As a surface receptor, for example, TNF receptor-1 (TNF-R1), it will interact with TNF to induce the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein (TRADD). This leads to a conformational change in the receptors in which homotrimers are formed in order to transduce the signal into the cell. This change exposes death domains on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptors that allow intracellular adaptor proteins to bind via their death domains. These adaptor proteins recruit molecules of caspase-8, a critical mediator of the extrinsic pathway, via death effector domains (DEDs), activating the caspase activation cascade. The cascade results in the cleavage of specific protein targets and causes apoptosis.

Comparison of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways

Intrinsic Pathway- The first major difference of the intrinsic pathway is that it does not depend on external stimuli. DNA damage and oxidative stress within the cell induce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the Bcl-2 family of proteins that act at the outer mitochondrial membrane. With two opposing subgroups, this family of proteins both inhibits and promotes apoptosis. Critical to the triggering of this pathway of apoptosis are the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of stored pro-apoptotic factors. All of the 25 members of the Bcl-2 family contain at least one Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain that mediates protein-protein interactions. An important subset of the pro-apoptotic molecules is the BH3-only proteins that unlike other family members only has one BH domain, rather than 3-4 domains. BH3-only proteins function either by inducing the activity of the pro-apoptotic molecules or binding and inhibiting the anti-apoptotic Blc-2 proteins. The pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAK and BID form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane while the anti-apoptotic members bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins to inhibit apoptosis. It is the balance of these two activities that regulates the release of important molecular apoptotic mediators from the mitochondria. Members of this protein family can associate by protein-protein interactions, allowing the ratio of their activities to determine function and the fate of the cell. It is necessary to note that the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways do converge at the activation of downstream caspases. 

Once Apoptosis is Triggered: 
After apoptosis is triggered through the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway, the execution process begins, and it is controlled by activated caspases. Once the cell starts this process, it cannot be stopped or reversed. First, pores open up in the mitochondrial membrane as a result of the pro-apoptotic molecules in the Bcl-2 family such as BAK and BID, causing the mitochondrial gradients fail. This means that the cell can no longer make ATP. The DNA condenses and transcription is stopped. The Golgi complex, the cytoskeleton, and the nuclear lamins begin to disintegrate. The nucleus begins to fragment into nucleosomes. The lipid bilayer begins to flip, exposing phosphatidylserine molecules to the outside. Phosphatidylserine is a death signal that attracts macrophages and activates phagocytosis by nearby cells. The cell then blebs, releasing small membrane bound pieces that can be phagocytosed by other cells. Overall, this is a orderly process that neatly destroys the cell. 

How this Fails in Cancer:  
Tumor cells do produce many signals that normally induce apoptosis, but tumor cells often acquire mutations that allow them to escape from apoptotic response and continue proliferation. As mutations accumulate in tumor cells with increased cell proliferation, so does the amount of apoptosis signals that the cell receives. As the apoptosis pathways of many cancer cells are defective due to p53 mutations, many people have begun to think that repair of the apoptotic pathway in tumor cells can be achieved by targeting p53 with new cancer therapeutics. Mutations in p53 can impact the functionality of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway as well as the intrinsic pathway. 

UV exposure activates both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway, UV exposure normally causes Fas death receptor clustering resulting in the caspase cascade, but mutations in these receptors can cause reduced apoptotic response in turn increasing the risk of skin cancer. 
Fas activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway
Also prevalent within cancers is the the suppression of caspase gene expression in the extrinsic pathway as a result of epigenetic and mutational alterations to the cell. This suppression prevents caspase-8 from beginning the caspase activation cascade that triggers apoptosis. 

More common among cancers are alterations in the intrinsic pathway. Mutations that prevent apoptotic signals in response to DNA damage, a common characteristic of cancers, are favored by natural selection. Mutations that affect p53 are major contributors to intrinsic pathway alterations. These type of mutations not only impact genes involved in the upstream regulation of p53 but also those involved in downstream targets of p53. 

Blc-2 is another major area where intrinsic pathway mutations can occur. Blc-2 is located next to a strong promoter (immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer) and due to this oncogenic activation of Bcl-2 occurs. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 causes the Bcl-2 family to act as oncogenes, where as pro-apoptotic members may act as tumor suppressors impacting bak and bid gene expression. Tumor cells could also have mutations in molecules involved in the downstream release of mitochondrial apoptotic factors, such as in the gene encoding Apaf-1. If mutated, this gene can be transcriptionally repressed, never being released from the mitochondria, and never activating caspase-9 or the apoptotic response. 
Overview of important molecules in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway

Impacting both pathways is the induction of the apoptotic inhibitor XIAP. XIAP is responsible for suppressing caspases-9,-3, and -7, which are all caspases involved in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.

H4C: Journal Article Summary
KLLN-mediated DNA damage-induced apoptosis is associated with regulation of p53 phosphorylation and acetylation in breast cancer cells  

General Background
KLLN: KLLN is a tumor suppressor protein that plays a role in the cells response to DNA damage. The transcription of KLLN is regulated by p53; additionally, KLLN has been found to bind to the promoters of p53 and CHK1. KLLN mutations are found in around 20% of breast carcinomas and are also found to increase the tumor grade in some forms of cancer. KLLN mutation also plays a role in Cowden Syndrome, which is an inherited condition characterized by benign tissue overgrowths and an increased risk of cancer. 
Other Relevant Proteins:
There are many other proteins involved in the DNA damage response pathway. The figure below illustrates the relevant part of this pathway, and proteins that are discussed in the paper are highlighted in yellow and described below.
DNA damage response pathway

ATM/ATR: ATM and ATR are kinases are recruited and activated by double strand breaks. These proteins act near the beginning of the DNA damage response pathway, and phosphorylate targets that lead to arrest of the cell cycle or apoptosis.
SIRT1: SIRT1 is an inhibitor of p53. Under normal conditions, SIRT1 deacetylates p53, keeping it inactive.
DBC1: DBC1 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM. DBC1 acts as a competitive inhibitor of SIRT 1, freeing p53 to be acetylated and activated.
CHK1/CHK2: CHK1 and CHK2 are proteins that coordinate cell cycle checkpoints and the DNA damage response.

Goals of the Study
This study was attempting to answer three main questions:

What is the role of KLLN in the DNA damage response?
Where does KLLN sit in the DNA damage response pathway?
What other proteins does KLLN interact with?

Results
The researchers began their experimentation by making sure that KLLN levels increased after DNA damage. To cause controlled DNA damage, the authors used doxorubicin, which is an antitumor antibiotic that intercalcates with DNA and can cause double and single strand breaks. The researchers then used an siRNA treatment to knockdown KLLN expression after DNA damage. siRNA are small pieces of double stranded RNA that are used to interfere with the translation of proteins by binding to mRNA. The researchers made sure that this treatment worked to knockdown KLLN, as they were relying on KLLN knockdown throughout the rest of their study. The results of these two tests are shown in the figure below; the left side shows normal KLLN levels after DNA damage, and the right side shows the knockdown of KLLN after siRNA treatment.
Effect of siKLLN treatment on KLLN levels after DNA damage

Next, the experimenters tested the effect of KLLN knockdown on the efficiency of the DNA damage response system. To do this, they looked at levels of γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage sites, and micronuclei frequency, a marker of genome instability, after DNA damage with KLLN knockdown. They found a decrease in γ-H2AX levels and an increase in micronuclei frequency in cells without KLLN. 

Conclusion: The DNA damage response cannot work efficiently without KLLN.
Effect of KLLN knockdown on apoptosis regulation

Next, the experimenters tested the role of KLLN on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis regulation. Using flow cytometry, the authors found that increased KLLN levels did not lead to greater S phase arrest after DNA damage. They then performed a TUNEL assay to assess the frequency of apoptotic nuclei. In KLLN knockdown cells, the experimenters found decreased numbers of apoptotic nuclei. They also performed a viability assay, which found that there was increased cell viability along with decreased apoptosis in KLLN knockdown cells. Immunobloting confirmed the role of KLLN in apoptosis regulation, by showing that KLLN knockdown resulted in decreased cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, which both serve as markers of apoptosis.

Conclusion: KLLN plays a role in apoptosis regulation, not cell cycle regulation, following DNA damage.

The authors next tested the effect of KLLN on p53 activity. Through immunoblotting, the authors found that KLLN knockdown cells had decreased levels of p53 phosphorylation after DNA damage. However, they found that KLLN knockdown did not have an effect on total p53 expression. The authors also found that KLLN knockdown does not have an effect on CHK2 phosphorylation or on overall CHK2 levels.

Conclusion: KLLN affects p53 phosphorylation after DNA damage, but does not affect CHK2.



Effect of KLLN knockdown on ATM and ATR phosphorylation

Next, the researchers looked at the influence of KLLN on ATM and ATR. ATM and ATR are both sensory DNA damage-response (DDR) proteins. The researchers found that after DNA damage in multiple cell lines there was an observed increase of Ser1981-phosphorylation of ATM and no increase in Ser428-phosphorylation of ATR. Then KLLN was knocked down to see the affect of KLLN expression on the regulation of ATM phosphorylation. In two cell lines there was no difference in phosphorylation of ATM after treatment and also no difference in total expression of ATM, as shown in parts i and ii of the figure above. In the MCF10A cell line they found a 30 percent decrease of ATM phosphorylation, indicated in part iii of the figure above. The researchers conclude from this that because of the fact that ATR is not affected by doxorubicin-induced damage, the change in expression of total phosphorylated ATR after KLLN knockdown suggest that ATR does not contribute to KLLN's role in p53 phosphorylation.  

Conclusion: KLLN regulation of p53 phosphorylation is likely not through the regulation of sensory DDR proteins such as ATM and ATR. 



Phosphorylation of DBC1 and DBC1 levels decreased in KLLN knockdown cells

Next, the researchers looked at interaction the interaction between KLLN and DBC1 since it was shown before that there is a connection between the two. They found that knocking down KLLN expression after doxorubicin induced DNA damage resulted in decreased Thr454-phosphorylation of DBC1 as well as total DBC1 expression in MCF10A (i) and MCF7 (ii), as shown in the figure above.

Conclusion: KLLN knockdown results in decreased DBC1 phosphorylation. 
Acetylation of p53 decreased in KLLN knockdown cells

The effect of lack of phophorylated DBC1 on p53 acetylation was confirmed by assessing acetyl-p53 expression. Knocking down KLLN expression followed by doxorubicin-induced DNA damage resulted in an expected decrease in Lys382-acetylation of p53 in MCF10A (i) and MCF7 (ii) cell lines, as shown in the figure above. 

Conclusion: KLLN's role in p53 acetylation after DNA damage is through the regulation of DBC1 phosphorylation. 


Overall role of KLLN in the DNA damage response (from the authors)

This figure above shows the author's placement of KLLN in the overall pathway of p53 activation after DNA damage. This right side of this figure shows that, normally, ATM phosphorylates the p53/SIRT1 complex and ATR phosphorylates DBC1. DBC1 then joins the p53/SIRT1 complex and causes SIRT1 to release p53. This frees up p53 to be acetylated and trigger apoptosis. On the left, the authors show the effect of KLLN knockdown on this pathway. When KLLN levels are reduced, ATM and ATR are unable to phosphorylate their targets, which means that p53 cannot be activated and apoptosis cannot be triggered. 

Discussion and Unanswered Questions
The authors of this study make a variety of claims about the role of KLLN:

The DNA damage response cannot work efficiently without KLLN
KLLN plays a role in apoptosis regulation, not cell cycle regulation, following DNA damage
KLLN affects p53 phosphorylation after DNA damage, but does not affect CHK2
KLLN regulation of p53 phosphorylation is likely not through the regulation of sensory DDR proteins such as ATM and ATR
KLLN knockdown results in decreased DBC1 phosphorylation
KLLN's role in p53 acetylation after DNA damage is through the regulation of DBC1 phosphorylation

This study had 3 main goals, which are discussed below:

What is the role of KLLN in the DNA damage response?
The authors established that KLLN does play a role in the DNA damage response
The role of KLLN is in apoptosis regulation, not cell cycle regulation
KLLN knockdown affects DBC1 phosphorylation and p53 activation, although its exact role is unclear
Where does KLLN sit in the DNA damage response pathway?
The authors illustrate the DNA damage response pathway, showing that KLLN knockdown affects the ability of ATM and ATR to phosphorylate their targets and inhibiting the rest of the pathway
It is unclear if this is the correct location for p53 in the pathway (see below)
This does not explain how normal p53 acts within the pathway, just what happens when it is not present
What other proteins does KLLN interact with?
KLLN regulates DBC1 phosphorylation, although the mechanism is not explained
KLLN does not affect ATM and ATR
KLLN does not affect CHK2
KLLN affects p53, although the mechanism is also not explained

As discussed in class, our main criticism of this paper is the conclusion that is supported by the authors' depiction of the overall pathway. Earlier in the paper, the authors state that KLLN does not affect ATM and ATR, and must control p53 phosphorylation through a different mechanism. They later find that KLLN regulates DBC1 phosphorylation, which explains its effects on p53 activation. The conclusion that KLLN does not affect ATM and ATR is clearly stated early in the paper, but the figure describing the overall pathway shows that KLLN is affecting the ability ATM and ATR to phosphorylate their targets. We found that the right side of this figure was taken directly from another paper. It is unclear whether the authors are actually saying that KLLN knockdown affects ATM and ATR or if they simply placed KLLN in the incorrect location when altering this figure to use for this paper. 

This study does leave us with some unanswered questions:

How do ATM and ATR actually fit in with KLLN?
Where does TRIM25 come in to this pathway? The authors briefly discuss TRIM25 in their conclusion, but offer no evidence or further information about the role of TRIM25 in the DNA damage response.
Can we trust the KLLN knockdown through siRNA? Could there be off-target effects that are affecting the findings?
What is the clinical significance of KLLN mutations? Can treatments be developed to target cancers with KLLN mutations?

H5A: Overview and History
KEY PRINCIPLES
As you explore this hallmark, here are several questions to keep in mind: 

What are telomeres? How are they maintained in human cells? What is their role in the development of cancer? 
How is the level and function of telomerase normally controlled in human cells? How is it de-regulated in cancer cells? 


OVERVIEW
Telomeres 
Telomeres cap and protect the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. These repetitive sequences are non-coding; they exist to protect the important coding DNA during replication, as the ends of chromosomes are shortened after each replication cycle. This shortening is thought to be the biological basis of aging. 

Telomeres need to be protected from a cell's DNA repair system because they have single-stranded overhangs, which could be perceived by the cell as damaged DNA. In humans, this overhang binds to complementary repeats in the dsDNA, causing the telomere ends to form protective loops, as shown below. Proteins such as Trf2 and shelterin complexes stabilize the formed loop.
Telomeres form protective loops to escape detection by DDR machinery.

Telomerase 
Telomerase is an enzyme that extends the telomeres of chromosomes. It has an embedded RNA template, which it uses to synthesize these repeated sequences. The enzyme is not usually active in somatic cells, but is active in some cell types that rapidly divide, such as stem cells. 

The molecular composition of human telomerase would found to consist of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA (TERC). The TERT polypeptide (the catalytic subunit of telomerase) carries the non-coding RNA, which serves as the template for the single-stranded telomere repeats. 

Telomeres and Cancer 
As cells undergo generations of replication, telomeres shorten substantially. This is because of DNA Polymerase's 5'-3' activity. As the lagging strand is replicated, RNA primers are added and eventually removed when DNA Polymerase is able to synthesize the Okazaki fragments. The extreme 5' end is not able to be synthesized, and this region is lost. Since this region is telomeric, no genetic material is lost. 
When telomeres become too short, the p53 pathway is activated to move the cell into senescence, since telomerase is no longer active to add more telomeres. This is a form of regulation to prevent cancer. 

When a cell does not have p53 activity, replication continues and the telomeres continue to shorten until the ends of the chromatids are unprotected. Non-homologous end joining causes the sister chromatids to have two centromeres, which results in uneven breakage at the mitotic spindle. The genome is unstable and without a functional apoptotic pathway, telomerase is activated and the cells are free to replicate infinitely. 


HISTORY
Discovery of Telomeres
Elizabeth Blackburn and Joseph Gall are credited with the discovery of telomeres. Using Tetrahymena thermophila as a model organism, they noted that chromosome ends contain a highly repeated six base sequence.

In 1989, Gregg Morin isolated telomerase for the first time in human cells using HeLa cells. HeLa cells are the world's oldest viable cell line--the line has been replicating since 1951. Morin found that human telomerase had a different base sequence than the telomerase found in Tetrahymena. He hypothesized that totipotent cells, like embryonic stem cells, produced telomerase. 

Morin's hypothesis was confirmed in 1994 by Mantell and Greider, who found that telomerase was highly active during development and necessary for development, but the amount of telomerase present was not predictive of the outcome of development. 

Discovery of Crisis 
In 1941, Barbara McClintock studied the chromosomes of corn. These studies revealed three things: 
1. A function of telomeres is to prevent end-to-end joining
2. When functional telomeres are lost, chromosomes fuse end-to-end. 
3. The resulting "mega-chromosome" has two centromeres.  


H5B: Cell Life Cycle and Differentiation
The Life Cycle of Cells
As we have already seen, cells can finish out their life cycle in a number of ways. Normally, p53 and Rb will trigger senescence, and the cell will stop dividing indefinitely. When there is some sort of irreparable damage in the cell, p53 will trigger the apoptosis pathway and the cell will die. Cells will also trigger apoptosis when its telomeres shorten (see below). The image below is something we've been looking at for a while now - it shows all of the different fates a cell can have based on the signals that are occurring. Now, we have added a part about cell damage/aging, which is important for this hallmark (photo credit: Dr. Johnson).


Cell Aging
As discussed on the previous page, each time a cell divides, each of its telomeres shortens. Therefore, as we age, our telomeres continue to become shorter and shorter. Leonard Hayflick estimated that each cell can divide a total of about 40 times before the telomeres of its daughter cells are too short to continue dividing. This is known as the Hayflick limit. This means that the cells in our body can undergo a total of 40 doublings, starting from the first division of our embryo. The image below shows how the Hayflick limit works for cells in culture; for humans, this occurs on a much larger timescale.

Additionally, as cells age, they begin expressing p16 (a.k.a. INK4a) and p21. Both p21 and p16 inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases, which prevents the progression of the cell cycle. You can see this in the above figure as the number of population doublings begins to plateau as it approaches the end of the measurement.

When the telomeres are gone...
The erosion is recognized as a double-stranded break and ATM/ATR are phosphorylated and the pathway shown below begins. They form aggregates (called SAHF - senescence-associated heterochromatin foci) at the site of the break. The histone protein γ-H2AX recognizes SAHF and signals to p53 to trigger senescence (via p16 and p21), thus preventing the cell from dividing any further.

(source)

Differentiation
As our cells begin to divide, they also begin to differentiate. The totipotent stem cell that eventually becomes a person is one of the only stages of differentiation in which cells are immortal - that is, they can rebuild their telomeres. As cells become more specific (see below), it is very difficult for them to return to a less-differentiated state.

H5C: Crisis
Telomere Erosion
In normal cells, telomeres erode in the absence of telomerase. Without telomerase, telomeres shorten with each replication cycle. 

This causes the telomeres to acquire proteins that cause DNA damage in a distinct pathway: 

Unprotected double-stranded DNA tail activates ATM-kinase
Loss of single-stranded overhang activates ATR
pATR and pATM form a SAHF (senescence associated heterochromatin foci), made of DNA damage response proteins 
H2AX -- A histone variant that functions in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage response
p53BP1 -- p53 binding protein that promotes non-homologous end joining
Mre11 complex -- Processes end breaks prior to NHEJ
p53-mediated senescence pathway activated through p21 (CDK inhibitor) and p16 (Rb inhibitor)

Connection
The activation of the p53 pathway as a result of telomeric dysfunction is another example of how p53 works as a tumor suppressor to prevent the growth of cancer. 
If p53 is made inactive through the loss of growth suppression or genomic instability, this pathway to senescence will not be operative. 

Crisis 
Cells that do not have active p53 bypass senescence and enter crisis after an additional number of generation populations (~10-20 after expected senescence). 
In normal cells, crisis should not occur because of the activation of the p53 pathway when the telomeres are very short. However, if crisis was to occur, the genomic instability would trigger mass apoptosis using the apoptotic pathway. 

Connection
The existence of crisis shows how different hallmarks of cancer influence one another. If p53 is not active, then crisis occurs. If the genome is unstable or the apoptotic pathway is not functioning, then crisis cannot be resolved. This results in further genomic instability. 

Crisis in Cancer Cells 
In cells that do not have mechanisms for apoptosis activated, the unprotected ends of chromosomes begin to fuse together, as seen in image B. This occurs in a mixture of homologous and non-homologous end joining. 
The presence of two centromeres prevents normal mitosis from occurring. An anaphase bridge is created as the spindle pulls apart the dicentric chromatids. The chromatids are separated unevenly, and neither side has a telomere. This allows for the two unprotected ends to join, or for non-homologous chromosomes to fuse. This process is called the Breakage-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) Cycle. The image below shows the differences between normal mitotic separation (top) and dicentric separation (bottom). 
In 90% of cells that undergo crisis, the TERT promoter is reactivated in order to induce the growth of new telomeres. 
In the other 10% of cells, the ALT pathway is activated. 
Both these pathways are discussed in details on the next page. 

H5D: Telomere Lengthening - TERT/ALT
MECHANISMS BEHIND IMMORTALITY
How do cancer cells acquire immortality? 
We will discuss two pathways by which cancer cells pull out of crisis and overcome replicative senescence. In most (90%) cancer cells, telomere length is maintained by reactivation of telomerase via the TERT promoter. Ten percent of cancer cells acquire immortality through a telomerase-independent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. 

The figure above summarizes the difference between telomerase and ALT-mediated telomere elongation. In the former, telomerase catalyzes the RNA-directed DNA synthesis of telomeres, while the latter relies on recombination and telomere DNA replication to extend telomeres. 

TERT PROMOTER MUTATIONS
Mutation hotspots
Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter have recently emerged as the most prevalent non-coding mutations in human cancers. The most frequent mutations in the TERT promoter are seen at positions 124bp and 146bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. These hotspot mutations are known as C228T and C250T. Mutations at both positions create a binding site for ETS transcription factors within the promoter. These TFs, as members of a pro-growth TF family, can then activate signaling pathways and result in downstream effects such as increased TERT mRNA transcription and telomerase activity. This thus stabilizes telomeres and allows the cell to evade senescence, contributing to the ability of cancer cells to replicate indefinitely.

TERT in the human genome
TERT is located on the tip of the p arm of chromosome 5, rendering it susceptible to translocation and possibly mutation, as the ends of chromosomes are more likely to be mutated. 

Clinical Significance
There are some treatment strategies targeting TERT. Some directly target and inhibit the catalytic core, inducing senescence. However, this process is slow-acting, as it takes time for telomeres to erode. Other treatments co-opt TERT, damaging telomeres. The caveat with this treatment is that you're exposing the DNA to oxidative damage and must co-inhibit the mitochondrial antioxidant response. 

ALT PATH
When is the ALT pathway activated? 
Pulling out of crisis via the ALT path is most often seen in mesenchymal and neuro-epithelial tumors. This could be explained by the fact that these cell types express little to no telomerase. ALT-positive cells are dependent on the activation of a homologous recombination DNA-repair mechanism to maintain telomere length. These cells are characterized by specific phenotypic features, such as heterogeneous telomere lengths.

How it works
Interestingly, inhibition of telomerase kills cancer cells, but activates the ALT pathway. The ALT pathway is activated by telomere instability. It is linked to mutations in ATRX, a chromatin remodeling protein that plays a key role in DNA methylation and thus regulation of gene expression. It's important to remember that the ALT mechanism is not inherently abnormal; it activates DNA damage repair signaling through ATM and ATR. Cells in which the ALT pathway is active depend on the activation of a homologous recombination DNA repair mechanism to maintain telomere length. If homologous recombination fails, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is activated.

Markers of ALT path activation
There are phenotypic elements characteristic of an active ALT pathway. One hallmark of the ALT pathway is the presence of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PNBs) anchored to telomeric DNA and proteins, as shown below. Using immunohistochemistry, we are able to visualize labeled telomeres and PMLs. The merged photo shows how telomeres and these bodies are related.

Another marker of the ALT pathway at work is the presence of nuclei with linear, c-circle fragments of telomeric DNA. The cell is trying to synthesize telomeres, but it gets messy. Thus, variable-length extensions of DNA (2-50 kb) can be seen. 

Clinical Significance
The ALT pathway is at work in about 60% of osteosarcomas and 40-60% glioblastomas. ALT pathway activation in tumors is often correlated to poor patient outcome. Currently, no cancer therapies specifically disrupt ALT pathways. Further investigation into the key players of the cis and trans elements that drive this process could provide insight into how disrupt the process and guide drug development.


TERT/ALT KARYOTYPES
Reactivating these mechanisms stabilizes lots of new karyotypes. In cancer cells, there is lots of mixing of genetic info as the cell undergoes a complete reorganization once telomeres are synthesized and stabilized. Cancer cells face strong negative selection until certain mutants are favored. The result is a "wave-like" appearance and disappearance of clonal groups until the cells most suited for survival will give rise to a mass. Below is a sampling of post-crisis karyotypes in colorectal cancers. These mutant karyotypes remain unstable and may rearrange further depending on the selection conditions.

H5E: Journal Article
OBHA ET. AL, 2016: MUTANT IDH1 EXPRESSION DRIVES TERT PROMOTER REACTIVATION AS PART OF THE CELLULAR TRANSFORMATION PROCESS

Background

Gliomas originate in neuronal support cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells) 
Gliomas make up 80% malignant brain tumors; most fatal of human tumors 
IDH1 gene: encodes isocitrate dehydrogenase (cat. isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate (a-KG) in CAC) 
Mutation at Arg-132 produces mutant IDH1 that generates 20hydroxyglutarate (2HG) 
2HG competes with a-KG for enzymes involved in histone methylation
IDH mutations in glioma associated with mutations in either: 
ATRX: chromatin remodeling protein
TERT promoter: when reactivated, increases telomerase expression and stabilizes telomeres

Key Questions

Does a mutation in IDH1 cause cellular transformation and immortalization? 
What are the mechanisms by which mutated IDH1 reactivates telomeres?

Results
Growth of cell populations over time
Figure 1B (left) follows the growth of cells in culture for one year, while table 1 (right) follows the growth of the cell lines on soft agar to measure in vitro transformation. The authors infected normal human astrocytes (NHA) with lentivirus (viral vector used to introduce genes) encoding GFP with one or more of the following: IDH1 WT, IDH1 mut, hTERT, or oncogenic HRasV12. Most cell lines were also infected with E6E7, HPV strains that render cells deficient in p53 and pRb. 

Of most interest to the authors was the NHA E6E7 IDH1 mut cell line, represented by green crosses. The growth pattern shows that these cultures entered crisis around day 100. The cell number remained relatively constant during crisis (day 100-175), followed by growth in culture and on agar after the cells escaped crisis. The authors injected these post-crisis cells into mice, finding that tumors formed in 4 of 10 animals (vs. no tumors formed in mice injected with WT IDH1). Because growth was seen on agar and in culture, the authors were able to confirm that IDH1 mut had the ability to transform cells, but cannot do so alone. The expression of hTERT in E6E7 showed growth in culture but not on agar, which agrees with the authors' thought that the expression of E6, E7 and hTERT immortalizes but does not transform NHA.  Thus, transformation and immortalization require a combination of these elements.

Methylation Patterns
One of the first things the authors looked at is whether IDH mutations affect histone methylation. The image below shows a gel in which the researchers probed for specific methylation patterns. The first two lanes are controls (empty vector and WT IDH, respectively), the third lane is pre-crisis cells, and the fourth lane is post-crisis cells. As you can see, nothing really changed between pre-crisis and post-crisis cells, so the authors concluded that, even though these sites were methylated more in IDH mutant cells, the methylation pattern was not what was causing cells to escape crisis, i.e. it was not causing cells to become immortal.


The authors also looked at the G-CIMP phenotype, which essentially means that CpG islands were being abnormally methylated. They found that this phenotype was, once again, not associated with escaping crisis.

Loss of Heterozygosity
The authors also looked at whether or not IDH mutation was associated with an increased frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) since this can lead to a number of genetic problems, including changes in hTERT expression. The figure below shows what they found. Minor allele frequency is the frequency that a minor allele (e.g. recessive allele that would not normally be expressed) is expressed. They used this as a measure of loss of heterozygosity. As you can see, there is a lot of green and red toward the top of the graph, which shows that post-crisis IDHmut cells had a much higher frequency of LOH.

ALT Pathway
The authors then tried to determine whether cells were being immortalized via the ALT pathway. Since ATRX is an indicator of use of the ALT pathway, they performed a western blot and looked at ATRX expression in pre-crisis and post-crisis IDH mutant cells (see A below). They found that ATRX expression was no different compared to the control both pre-crisis and post-crisis. Since ATRX expression didn't change, the authors concluded that the ALT pathway was likely not being used. 
Just to be sure, they performed two more experiments: they probed for indicators of ALT pathway using FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) (see below; the image on the left is a positive control) and using a DNA gel. For the FISH (below), they used a fluorescent probe that binds to specific regions of telomeres that are indicative of ALT lengthening. In the IDH mutant cells (middle and left) they did not see any fluorescence, which indicates that the ALT pathway was not being used.
For the DNA gel, it is known that the ALT pathway results in telomeres of varying lengths, while telomerase usually makes telomeres that are around 5 kilobases, so we would expect that a DNA gel from cells using the ALT pathway would have multiple bands while a gel from cells using telomerase would have one single, broader band. In the figure below, you can see that the cells they were using in this experiment all had one distinct band, which suggests that these cells were using the telomerase pathway to achieve immortality. For the gel below, lanes 2-6 and 11 are various controls. Lanes 7-9 are IDH wild-type pre-crisis, in crisis, and post-crisis, respectively, and lane 10 is IDH mutant. 

TERT Promoter
After determining that the cells were not immortalized via the ALT pathway, they tested whether the IDH mutation effected the TERT promoter. The TERT promoter is a subunit of telomerase, and a mutation could activate telomerase. It was previously known that n228 and n250 are two common mutations of the TERT promoter in cells immortalized through this pathway. A sequence analysis was done on the TERT promoter in cells with IDH mutation. It was found that neither mutation was present in pre- nor post-crisis cells, which was the first indication that IDH did not effect the TERT promoter. 

In a second experiment, they measured the mRNA expression of the TERT promoter using qPCR. The negative control for this experiment was E6E7, since there was no oncogene present, so there should be no expression of the TERT promoter. The positive control was E6E7 hTERT. The results show that there is a significant difference between the expression of the TERT promoter in IDH mutant cells pre- and post-crisis. This supports their hypothesis that IDH does not operate via the TERT promoter. The increase in expression post-crisis is expected, since the TERT promoter is activated to rescue from crisis. Also, the levels of expression are considerably low compared to the positive control (40 vs 32,000). If IDH worked via the TERT promoter, there would have been expression pre-crisis. 

To confirm that IDH does not work through the TERT promoter, the authors performed a TRAP analysis. This is a time-series RNA-seq analysis package, which measures telomerase activity. They measured with heat added (-HT) and without heat added (+HT). The only activity was seen in the positive controls (lanes 3, 5, 10) and IDH mutant post-crisis, which is consistent with the previous results. 

TERT Promoter Activity
Finally, the authors studied whether or not the DNA for the TERT promoter had methylation patterns consistent with an active TERT promoter. Basically, is the TERT promoter is on but not working. They first added luciferase tag that was driven by SV40 (positive control), no promoter (negative control), or the TERT promoter. The results show that with the hTERT promoter, there was no difference in the amount of luciferase activity between the IDH wildtype, pre-crisis mutant, or post-crisis mutant. This suggests that TERT promoter activity is related to accessibility of TERT promoter, not increase in transcription factors that favor TERT. 

Next, ChIP was used to measure the levels of protein binding to the H3K4me3 or Max binding sites to look for DNA with methylated activity. ZNF333 an TERT-3 are used as controls, as they both lack a promoter region. Unsurprisingly, both of these had low levels of both H3K4me3 and Max binding. The high levels of H3K4me3 and Max in the post-crisis TERT promoter suggests that crisis results in a H3K4me3 active state that allows for the binding of Max and TERT promoter activation. 
Conclusions

IDH mutations do not work via the TERT nor the ALT pathway
There is potentially a third pathway resulting in immortalization that is independent of TERT and ALT 
Clinical significance: Many researchers are working on the therapeutic targeting of telomerase to prevent immortalization. Many of these potential treatments target TERT or ALT and by suggesting a third pathway, these treatments might not be effective in all types of cancer. 

Unanswered Questions

If IDH mutations do not work via TERT promoter or ALT pathway, by what mechanism does it work? 
What experiments could be done to uncover this pathway?

H6A: Background
-The immune system is a network of cells, signals, and organs that help protect against dangerous pathogens and cancer.

-Cancer researchers used to believe that the immune system could not fight tumors because the body did not recognize them as foreign. This has been found to be an over-generalization, cancers utilize a number of different methods to evade the immune response.

First, let's define some immune terminology:
Antigen- a molecule capable of generating an immune response
Antibody- a protein produced by lymphocytes in response to an antigen, and which can specifically bind the antigen as part of the immune response
Pathogen- a microorganism that can cause disease
Cytokines- small secreted proteins which are the major cell signaling proteins of both B and T-cells.

- The immune system plays a dual role in cancer: it has both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. Very generally, the adaptive immune system seems to destroy cancer cells, while the innate immune system seems to drive cancer progression (this will be elaborated upon).

- Cells of the immune system are derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. 





- The adaptive immune system uses specific antigens to strategically mount an immune response. Unlike the innate immune system, which attacks only based on the identification of general threats, the adaptive immunity is activated by exposure to pathogens and uses an immunological memory to learn about the threat and enhance the immune response accordingly. The adaptive immune response is much slower to respond to threats than the innate immune response, which is ready to react at all times [Khan Academy].

- The innate immune system causes inflammation which releases growth factors and ROS (reactive oxygen species) that promote cancer cell growth and genomic instability. Specifically, ROS can cause oxidative damage to DNA that contribute to oncogenic mutations.

- In the adaptive immune system, T and B-cells recognize invaders by their antigens. Any T or B-cell that recognizes molecules found in its host body's cells are destroyed during fetal development to prevent an autoimmune response. Millions of the remaining immune cells survive to respond to foreign antigens [sciencemuseum.org].


- The adaptive immune system responds to cancer-associated antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with T-cells that subsequently trigger cancer cell lysis and death. B-cells respond to cancer antigens by producing antibodies that can recognize these antigens and allow for a specific attack. T-cells and B-cells release cytokines to integrate the specific immune response. Both T-cells and B-cells can gain memory that allows them to respond to later threats more quickly.

- Tumors, however, can find a way around the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system exerts selective pressure on cancer cells that shape the antigens displayed on their surfaces, leading to the evasion of the immune system and cancer promotion. In addition, tumors consume vast quantities of glucose that immune cells could use for energy. Finally, some tumors are associated with molecules that inhibit immune invasion and attack.

H6B: Adaptive and Innate Immunity
The immune system is meant to keep foreign pathogens like proteins, parasites, bacteria, viruses or fungi out of our bodies or to kill them before they can cause damage.

Let's review adaptive and innate immunity in more depth...
There are 2 types of immune responses: The adaptive and the innate.


This is a map displaying pathways of the adaptive, innate, humoral, and cell-mediated immune systems. We will discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems in more depth in a bit. The humoral immune system uses antibodies created by B cells to prevent extracellular organisms from creating disease within body fluids. The cell-mediated system just refers to the system that activate phagocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes and cytokines as a result of antigen binding instead of antibodies. The humoral and cell-mediated systems fit within the adaptive immune system (how exactly they work together will be explained later).

But we will focus on the innate and adaptive immune systems.




The Innate Immune System

Quick response 
This system does not "remember" pathogens, it just blocks whatever it doesn't recognize as "self". It's non-specific. 
Can serve as our body's "first line of defense" 
Keeps things from entering your body
Uses barriers such as our skin, acidic oils, stomach acids
Also serves as our body's "second line of defense"
Has specific targets
Triggers inflammatory responses regulated by damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS) and Pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPS) that bind to toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, AIM2-like receptors, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to promote destruction of the tissue. 
Redness
Swelling 
Pain 
Dysfunction
Uses phagocytes 
Types of phagocytes: 
Neutrophils are fast responding cells that die right after killing a pathogen
Macrophages are tougher monocyte white blood cells and can kill more than one pathogen
Dendritic cells activate the adaptive immune system. This figure shows how the dendritic cells are involved in B cell and T cell activation.
Natural killer cells can kill your own cells if they don't contain Major Histocompatibility Complex 1. Cancer cells, for example, stop making this complex. In this case, the NK cell will trigger apoptosis instead of ingesting the cell.
Phagocytes can can eat foreign pathogens
They have receptors that respond to the presence of bacteria
The phagocyte wraps itself around the pathogen and digests it
It will take pieces of the peptides from the digested pathogen and bind it with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and present it on its membrane so that the specific adaptive immune system can be triggered
This makes the presented peptide from the pathogen the antigen and the phagocyte presenting the antigen the antigen presenting cell.
Phagocytes are non-specific, meaning they just kill anything that is foreign


The Adaptive Immune System

Acts based on your exposure to things
Your body's exposure to an antigen better prepares it for future encounters with that antigen. 
Uses lymphocytes 
White blood cells that can be broken down into 2 subtypes.
Types of lymphocytes:
B-lymphocytes
Produced in bone marrow
Have membrane-bound antibodies on their membranes that help them respond to thousands of different antigens (but each B cell only responds to one specific antigen)
They are not activated until they recognize and bind to a particular antigen.
They then clone themselves and make antibodies that can respond to more of that specific pathogen.
B-lymphocytes are involved in humoral response by secreting molecules, which helps destroy pathogens that have not yet infiltrated cells. For example, if the virus or bacteria are just floating around in the fluids of the body, this mechanism will respond.
They present antigens on their surfaces for recognition and immunity
T-lymphocytes
Produced in the bone marrow but then mature in the thymus 
Can be broken down into the T-cells and the Cytotoxic T-cells
T-cells release cytokines which serve as a chemical signals to cytotoxic T-cells. The cytotoxic T-cells can then recognize receptors of antigens, bind to the antigen-MHC complex and kill the antigen by releasing enzymes or inducing apoptosis. Then it can just detach and move on to other antigens.

Involved in the cell-mediated response, which responds by cell-cell interaction after cells have already been infiltrated with the virus or bacteria. 


So again, this map sums up the innate, adaptive, humoral, and cell-mediated immune systems and how they are interconnected. 


Key Molecules for Inflammation driven by Macrophages:

NF-kB is triggered by DAMPs and PAMPs to respond to wounds along with COX2
IL-1B promotes systemic inflammation
TNF promotes wound response and proliferation by Cyclin D and Myc
IFN-Y 
IL-6 respond to issue destruction
ROS and NOS respond to tissue damage
hydrolytic enzymes
and growth factors

When wound healing response fails...

IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-a promote angiogenesis
ROS and NOS promote gene damage and tissue destruction and Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) create scar tissue

H6C1: Immune Checkpoints and Immune Evasion
Immune system and cancer- when all goes well


The immune system naturally protects against cancer. Here are some ways the immune system acts as a tumor-suppressive defense are:

Protects against viral and bacterial infections, which can be causative agents
Resolves inflammation, which otherwise promotes cancer
Recognizes and kills tumor cells



Figure 1. The cancer immunity cycle.

The figure above depicts the cancer immunity cycle. Essentially, the steps are as follows:

Release of cancer cell antigens upon tumor cell death
Presentation of antigens on APCs (antigen-presenting cells)
Priming and activation of T cells
Transport to tumors via bloodstream
Infiltration of T cells into tumors
Recognition of cancer cells
Tumor cell death via perforin and granzymes

The antigens are fundamental for immunosurveillance, as they allow recognition of the cancer cells as different from "self" cells. Cancer specific antigens that are red flags to the immune system arise from mutations that cause the cell to either a) express protein products that are altered as a result of the mutation or b) result in mis-regulated gene expression.


Immune system and cancer- when things start to go wrong


As awesome as the immune system is, too much of a good thing can be bad. An over-active immune system could result undesirable effects, such as decreased self-tolerance, leading to autoimmune responses, and tissue damage. Many of the issues involved in the over-active immune system are linked to the inflammatory response, which the cancer cells can hijack to benefit the proliferation and survival of the tumor cells (see more of an explanation of this under tumor-tissue interactions, specifically the wound response). Luckily, the immune system has checkpoints that allow the cells to monitor and tightly regulate immune responses. 

Overview of T cell activation

Figure 2. Full T cell activation.

T cells are activated upon interaction with antigens that are bound to MHC molecules, signaling for downstream effects to occur that allow immune response. Yet, this is incomplete- to be fully activated, T cells need to have an interaction between:

CD28, found on the T cell 
B7 ligands, found on the APC

This would then enable T cells to begin proliferation and differentiation.

Image result for t cell ctla4 and cd28

Figure 3. CTLA-4 inhibition of T cell proliferation.

Once this activation occurs, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, CTLA-4, moves from intracellular vesicles to the T cell membrane. CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for binding to ligand B7. When CTLA-4 binds B7, proliferation of T cells is inhibited. Thus, CTLA-4 acts as a negative feedback for T cell activation. 


Figure 4. Co-inhibitory and co-simulator signals between APCs and T cells that determine inhibition or activation of T cell response. 

However, CTLA-4 is not the only co-inhibitor molecule that can regulate T cell response. The figure above shows other known co-inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions that impact whether or not the T cell will continue with the immune response. Other co-inhibitory molecules include:

Programmed death 1 protein, PD1
Found on T cell
Expressed when activated T cells produce interferon-𝛾
Programmed death protein 1 associated ligands
PD-L1
PD-L2

These recognition checkpoints that enable inhibition of T cell activation are prime targets for tumor cells to hijack in order to evade destruction. 


Figure 5. Drugs that inhibit the immune checkpoints, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. 

Anti-CTLA-4, -PD1, and -PD-L1/2 are all targets of recent immunotherapies aimed at improving patients' immune response. These drugs are designed to inhibit immune checkpoints, theoretically enabling the T cells to be activated and destroy the cancer cells. There has been some success with these therapies, however, the variable success is likely a result of the biomarkers that are particular to that tumor. Trials are beginning to look into combinations of immunotherapy drugs. All these drugs can cause adverse auto-immune and inflammatory responses, so there is still work to be done. 

H6C2: Immunoediting and Therapeutic Strategies
Other mechanisms of immune evasion

Immunoediting is the term that describes the interaction between the tumor and the immune response that creates a dynamic interplay as the tumor progresses.



Figure 6. Immunoediting phases.

Immunoediting has three phases:

Elimination- destroying cancer
Local elimination
Cytokines from early tumor development initiate anti-tumor response, both innate and adaptive immunity
Dendritic cells react to stromal remodeling and initiate inflammatory response, attracting natural killer cells and macrophages
Natural killer cells and macrophages kill cancer cells via production of ROS
Regional elimination
Dendritic cells, with the antigens, present to and activate T cells
T cells recognize the tumor cells with this antigen
T cells proliferate and emigrate to the tumor site, bind to the target cells via MHC-1, and kill the tumor cells 
Equilibrium- selection of less immunogenic cells
A portion of the cancer cells were not eliminated
Those that are weakly immunogenic fly under the radar of the immune system
Selection occurs to favor cells that evade elimination by the immune system, perhaps by favorable mutations, allowing less potent antigens
Escape- tumor evades the immune system

This promotes tumor formation by inducing selective forces on the tumor cells to select for the cells that can be ignored by the immune system.


Figure 7. Immune destruction evasion mechanisms.

There are many other ways in which a tumor may escape immune destruction. Figure 7 includes just a few of them. Others include:

Inducing T cell apoptosis via release of soluble FasL, TGF-β, or IL-10
Neutralize toxins via peroxidase inactivation
Neutralize complement via overexpression of proteins that regulate complement
Repress phagocytosis via overexpression of CD47




Figure 8. Therapeutic strategies for immunotherapy.

The diversity of immune evasion mechanisms calls for a diversity in therapeutic strategies. 

Therapeutic antibodies- interfere with signal transduction and/or interact with receptors on immune cells to enable antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis
Cancer vaccines
Therapeutic- essentially the MHC-1 recognition process, wherein proteins are degraded and shuttled to surface where dendritic cells pick up the antigens and stimulate APCs to activate T cells
Whole cell- bacteria or viruses that are disarmed, but still elicit some immune response
Peptide based- part of antigen that have differential expression patterns in tumor cells 
Dendritic cell- isolated, cultured, and loaded or pulsed with specific antigens so they may initiate a T cell response
Prophylactic- prepare the immune system prior to cancer
Checkpoint blockades- as mentioned earlier, drugs that target and inhibit the action of CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 in halting T cell proliferation
Adoptive T-cell transfer- cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are cultured ex vivo so that they may attack cancer cells
Chimeric antigen receptors, CARs, are used to increase the affinity of T cells for tumors via emulating a chain of sequences encoding variable regions of antigen binding to monoclonal antibodies that code for TCR complex, which induces T cell activation
Oncolytic viruses and virotherapy- selectively infect and kill tumor cells via lysis after viral replication


H6D: Jiang 2018 Article
Introduction:
Here is an overview of how T-cell activation, inhibition and prolonged activation normally take place.
Figure 1. T-cell activation

First, the T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) have to recognize each other


Antigens have MHC complexes on their surfaces and the APCs present those to the T cells

They do this by recognizing the same peptide

This sends a signal for possible T cell activation

The T-cell can now proliferate, migrate and destroy intruders


T-cell inhibition

The T cell and antigen-presenting cell have to recognize each other just like with activation
But now, the CD28 receptor on the surface of the T cell has to bind with the B7 ligand on the surface of the APC

T cell remains active

Imagine the initial activation by the initial recognition and the binding of CD28 to B7 has already occurred
Next, a mono-clonal antibody binds to the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and stabilized the other 2 bounds so that they cannot be broken, so the T-cell remains activated for extended periods of time
This allows for more proliferation and higher immune response
This is the strategy used for Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) 

Background on the article:


⅓ of patients respond to Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)

Targets: PD-L1, PD1 and CTLA4

Effectiveness depends on several biomarkers

Scientists developed Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE)

Computational model for predicting ICB response

Hypotheses:


The authors thought that transcriptome signatures could serve as a reliable biomarker to predict ICB response. They combined these signature profiles of treated tumors with patient survival outcome to identify regulators of T cell dysfunction. T cell exclusion signatures were related to gene expression of CAFs, MDSCs, and TAMs. 


They also investigated some genes with high scores in TIDE signatures that could serve as ICB resistance regulators, in addition to the biomarker predictor. 



They reported three cell types that restrict T cell infiltration in tumors:

cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)

-normal fibroblasts help with the production of the extra-cellular matrix, but CAFs secrete growth factors that lead to angiogenesis

myeloid-derived supPressor cells (MDSCs) 

-they can suppress t cell responses

M2 subtype of tumor-associated

macrophages (TAMs)

-promote metastasis and inhibit immune responses by T cells

They also reported 2 Mechanisms of tumor immune evasion:

High infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (dysfunction)
This means the normal response of the T-cells was somehow inhibited or highjacked by the cancer cells. 
So even if the cells were able to enter into the tumor, they don't do their jobs. 
2. Low infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (exclusion)
This means that the cytotoxic T cells never actually successfully entered into the tumor
So this would mean they weren't able to fight off the cancer even if they had normal function

Methods:


TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) is a catalog of genetic mutations contributing to cancer, found by using genome sequencing and bioinformatics.
This research utilized tumor cell data from TCGA and other cancer gene databases. Experimenters developed the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) equation to model methods of immune evasion. TIDE is simply a computation.

Experimenters selected for cells with cytotoxicity T cell marker genes CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB and PRF1 within these databases.  From these markers, they classified tumors as CTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte) high or CTL low.

Experimenters chose the following as markers for immune exclusion: cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and the M2 subtype of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).

Researchers used other markers to determine accumulated T-cells, exhausted T-cells, regulatory T-cells (used a CD4 marker), and ICB resistant (used a CTLA4 marker). 

Researchers used a variation of a Kaplan-Meier curve. A Kaplan-Meier shows the probability that a cancer-related outcome occurs in the presence versus absence of a particular variable. K-M curves display a single factor. The experimenters used a statistical method that extends the K-M to assess several risk factors simultaneously called the Cox proportional hazards regression. 

The authors are trying to PREDICT the Cox Hazard ratio using a general linear equation model applied to these data.

ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of the Cox curves. The ROCs shows how many true positive results vs false positive results are yielded.

Mice tumor cells were isolated to examine the Serpinb9 protease inhibitor and other pertinent proteins.

Serpbinb9 was knocked out via CRISPR and overexpressed via cDNA.

To confirm knockout and overexpression, as well as the presence of other pertinent proteins, experimental mice tumor cells were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and flow cytometry was used for analysis.

Figure 2. In order to detect cancer cell protein expression, a flow cytometry apparatus was used.

Tumor cells mixed in solution flowed through the apparatus to the narrow area, where a laser light passed through the solution to refract and be absorbed by receivers that digitized the pattern into fluorescence data. The data was analyzed using the knowledge that the light refracted according to the presence or absence of target proteins.

Results:

Figure 1. Gene signatures of T-cell dysfunction

a) These cox curves show the survival over time for individuals with high CTL level tumors and low CTL level tumors. The first curve indicates that in patients with high TGFB1, there is no significant difference in the survival fraction between the two groups with a p-value of 0.78. In the second curve, it is indicated that in patients with low TGFB1, low CTL tumors have a statistically significant lower survival fraction than high CTL tumors with a p-value of 0.0016

b) This is the general linear equation model applied to the dysfunction data. Higher hazard is increased dysfunction. When D (a variable that describes the interaction of CTL and a candidate gene for dysfunction) is greater than zero, it raises the hazard. The opposite is true when D<0.

c) Shows genes with significant T-cell dysfunction scores in multiple cancer types. Uses z score which is just d/standard error. Orange stars indicate genes of special interest.

SUMMARY:

These results indicate that TGFB1 is interfering with the ability of CTLs to attack tumor cells. This is indicated because, in high TGFB1 levels, patients have no difference in prognosis when CTLs infiltrate the tumor than when they do not infiltrate at all. This figure also indicates the genes associated with T-cell dysfunction via the TIDE computation, which include: PD-L1, TGFB1, SERPINB9, and SOX10.



Figure 2. T-cell dyfunction and evasion

a) Box and whiskers plot of positive and negative hits for certain markers and their correlation with dysfunction. The positive or negative hits are defined as genes upregulated or downregulated in the process of T cell dysfunction or ICB resistance, respectively. T accum: shRNA screens for regulators of T cell accumulation in tumors; T exhaust: transcriptome of exhausted T cells; T regulatory: transcriptome of CD4 regulatory T cells. ICB resist: transcriptome of murine tumors that resist anti-CTLA4 checkpoint blockade. For each of these cell-types, a significant difference was seen between positive and negative hit groups.

b) ROC curve of true-positive plotted vs false positive rate. 

c) Shows the area under the curve for each group in the ROC graph. The highest area is the T-exhaust while the lowest is the T-accum. The greater the area means that the group had a higher true-positive rate.

d) Shows that there is a correlation in late-stage tumors between T-cell exhaustion and dysfunction

SUMMARY:
These results, in summary, indicate that the genes selected are good indicators of T-cell dysfunction.



Figure 3. T cell exclusion. 

a) Negative correlation between CTL levels and immunosuppressive cell signatures (T cell exclusion)- all the cell types were reported to restrict T cell infiltration
MDSC- myeloid-derived suppressor cells
Immunosuppressive cells that interact with T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells to regulate their function
TAMs- tumor associated macrophages
CAFs- cancer-associated fibroblasts

b) Correlation report of CTL levels vs. T cell exclusion across tumors

c) Tumor T cell dysfunction and tumor T cell exclusion are inversely correlated

d) Kidney renal cell carcinoma has the highest CTL and T cell dysfunction (stronger T cell dysfunction, impairing T cell ability to kill tumor cells) and lung squamous carcinoma has lowest CTL levels and highest exclusion, with lowest dysfunction
In melanoma, higher CTL suggested better outcome (if TGFB1 low bc otherwise it can help with immunoescape), but kidney renal cell carcinoma is different because of high levels of T cell dysfunction. Higher CTL is correlated with a better outcome if the T cells are still functional

SUMMARY:

These results display the correspondence between T cell exclusion and CTL levels, as well as the relationship between T cell exclusion and T cell dysfunction. CTL levels were determined by CD8A/B, GZMA/B, and PRF1, essentially the crucial proteins that enable cytotoxic T cells to kill target cells. Essentially, these findings demonstrate that:

T cell exclusion is correlated with seeing less CTL levels in tumors, or simply put, T cells are excluded from tumors in T cell exclusion
T cell exclusion and T cell dysfunction are somewhat mutually exclusive
Kidney renal cell carcinoma has high CTL levels and high dysfunction which suggests the T cells are being destroyed upon entering the tumor microenvironment



Figure 4.  ICB response prediction by TIDE. Rows show results of melanoma tumors with anti-PD1, melanoma tumors with anti-CTLA-4, and across various tumor types with anti-PD1.

a,b,c) Responder or non-responder to therapy, ranked by TIDE scores based on CTL expression markers to predict ICB response
Melanoma patients were the only ones to have data on treatment with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4, tumor expression and clinical outcomes 

d,e,f) Show the true to false positive rate using ROC
TIDE does better at predicting ICB response than other ICB biomarkers (PD1 levels, interferon gamma response)
Perhaps because TIDE considered dysfunction and exclusion while other biomarkers only focused on one aspect

g,h,i) Area under the curve, providing evidence ranking the best (most true, least false) true/false positive rate
TIDE is best predictor for anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4

j,k,l) Overall survival based on top and bottom TIDE prediction scores

SUMMARY: 
Theses results suggest TIDE does the best job at predicting ICB compared to other biomarkers. One possible explanation is that TIDE takes into account T cell dysfunction and T cell exclusion, while other biomarkers only focus on one aspect.


Figure 5. Immune escape.

a) Log fold change- Serpinb9 was the most upregulated gene between anti-CTLA-4 resistant and parental cells
Serpinb9 is a serine protease inhibitor that acts on granzyme B to disarm the cytotoxic effect of T cells

b) Expression value for Serpinb9

c) Progression free survival and overall survival with top and bottom half of patients Serpinb9 levels
PFS- stable tumor
OS- just checking if alive, not how the tumor is doing

d) KO and overexpression of Serpinb9, with IFN-y to induce Serpinb9 expression
IRF1, a TF activated by INF-y, binds near Serpinb9 gene

e) B16 or parent cell to T cell ratio of KO
Lots more T cells than tumor cells- ratio changing shows balance rather than absolute

f) B16 or parent cell to T cell ratio of overexpression


SUMMARY:


Serpinb9, the serine protease inhibitor, acts on granzyme B to disarm the cytotoxic effect of T cells. The expression of this gene product is statistically significant between parental and immune-resistant tumor cells. 



Discussion

TIDE is trained from pre-treatment data and predicts ICB response
TIDE is able to predict regulators of ICB resistance, as inhibition of these regulators may improve ICB response
Serpinb9
Some cancers have lots of CD8 T cell infiltration, yet high CTL levels are not associated with survival benefits
Strong dysfunction that disarms T cells and make the high levels irrelevant
There needs to be more data to create a more robust scoring for the individual, rather than for average for T cell dysfunction
Cancer type specific regulators may help mitigate the variations in T cell dysfunction

Limitations

Focused only on gene expression biomarkers, even though other biomarkers 
B-catenin protein levels have negative correlation with CTL in many other cancer types
Mutations occur after first-line ICB, yet TIDE is trained on first-line ICB response
B2M, IFNGR1/2, and JAK1/2 are all genes that are known to become ICB resistant later
Also, there is a focus on intrinsic ICB resistance
Need more data on CTL marker expression in normal tissue
They lack this control measure
Only used 48/73 data sets, and only compared 5 different cancer types
Although, we did discuss in class that due to the novelty of the immunotherapy field, the few data sets they could work with are likely due to the lack of information about these biomarkers

Next steps

Differential therapies that target the specific cell type
After first line ICB response to account for mutations induced later
Serpinb9 inhibitor to enable better ICB response

Connections

Loss of tumor suppression leads to uninhibited cell growth that requires increased production of biomolecules to keep up with the rapid proliferation. This demand for precursors is somewhat met by the upregulation of serine/glycine metabolism and glutamine metabolism. Read more about the loss of key tumor suppressors like Rb on H2B and other specialized tumor suppressors on H2C. Additionally, the ability of the cell to become immortalized is relevant to sustaining this uninhibited amount of proliferation, which is discussed more on H5B. 

P53 has a wide range of regulatory roles that go well beyond metabolic pathways. Glutamine synthesis has a complex relationship with both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Glutamine is known to stimulate p53, which in turn activates glutaminase.See H4A for more information about the structure and functions of p53.

The role of p53 in metabolic regulation. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135642/
How oncogenes and tumor suppressors relate to glutamine metabolism   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189465/

Oncogenes regulate enzymes involved in glutamine metabolism, which can contribute to the Warburg Effect. Several mechanisms can contribute to the activation and overexpression of oncogenes, discussed in detail on H1D. Overactivation of the insulin receptor can also upregulate glucose uptake and activate oncogenic pathways, such as the PI3K and RAS pathways, which are discussed on H1B. 

By reprogramming metabolic pathways, cancer cells uptake large quantities of glucose and glutamine. Immune cells rely on these nutrients to meet their energetic demands; thus, altered tumor energetics can contribute to immune evasion. Mechanisms of immune evasion are discussed in further detail on H6C.

Cancer cells often upregulate ATF4, mimicking a nutrient-deprived state and exploiting pro-survival effects of the ATF4-mediated integrated stress response (ISR). Avoidance of apoptosis via dysregulation of key players in apoptotic pathways can enable cancer cells to selective exploit the pro-survival effects of the ISR. See H4B for more details on the mechanisms by which cancer cells avoid apoptosis.

There is evidence against the direct hypotheses for explaining the benefits of the Warburg Effect for cancer cells which has shifted research into looking at indirect hypotheses. The evidence against the direct hypotheses is discussed further on H7B. Studies have looked different indirect ways that cancer cells have benefitted from the Warburg effect.

H7A: Normal Glucose Metabolism

Normal Glucose Metabolism

Before we dive into the aspects of metabolism that become dysregulated in cancer, it is important to understand some of the basics of normal glucose metabolism.


Glucose is taken into cells via facilitated diffusion using GLUT transporters.

To increase glucose uptake, a cell simply moves a vesicle containing GLUT transporters to the plasma membrane. To reduce glucose uptake, the GLUT transporters are endocytosed.





In the cytoplasm, glucose enters glycolysis.

During glycolysis, electrons are extracted from glucose-derived intermediates and added to NAD+
Outputs of glycolysis include: NADH, 2 ATP, and 2 molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons)
Various branches off of the main glycolytic pathway allow for the synthesis of important cellular materials:
The pentose shunt generates 5 carbon sugars (riboses) for nucleotide synthesis as well as NADPH.
The production of serine from 3PG is important for amino acid synthesis.
The lactate shunt allows for the regeneration of NAD+. NADH donates its electrons for pyruvate, resulting in the production of lactate, which is transported out of the cell. The production of lactate allows the cell to regenerate NAD+ so that it can continue to utilize glycolysis to generate 2 ATP under anaerobic conditions. 
After leaving the cell, lactate travels to the liver where it is eventually converted back into glucose.

Normally, under aerobic conditions, pyruvate can be transported into the mitochondrion via the pyruvate shuttle.

Inside the mitochondrion, pyruvate can then be converted into acetyl coA and enter the TCA cycle.
The TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) generates free electrons which are captured by NAD+, forming NADH
NADH delivers these electrons to the electron transport chain, resulting in the production of 34 molecules of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.
Oxidative phosphorylation also results in the regeneration of NAD+ for glycolysis and the production of water.
Branches off of the TCA cycle.
Citrate can be transported out of the mitochondria and used in fatty acid/lipid synthesis. High levels of lipid  synthesis are important for dividing cells in order to generate new membrane for daughter cells. 
Amino acid synthesis

Cells are constantly switching between utilizing glucose for energy or for building macromolecules.

A cell molds its metabolic pathways to fit its current needs by regulating flux (relative activity of progression through a certain pathway).
Flux is tightly controlled by enzyme activity, which in turn is regulated by metabolites, regulatory proteins, and other signaling molecules.



The regulation of these pathways becomes completely scrambled in tumor cells, leading to abnormal metabolism.

H7B: The Warburg Effect

Abnormal Metabolism in Cancer Cells: The Warburg Effect



In the 1920’s, Otto Warburg  noticed that tumor cells show a colossal increase in the rate at which glucose is being metabolized.


Image result for otto warburg

Otto Warburg


As previously mentioned, when oxygen is not available (anaerobic conditions), normal cells will cycle repeatedly through glycolysis, generating 2 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. To regenerate NAD+ and keep the process running, NADH donates electrons to pyruvate, producing lactate. Lactate can then be transported out of the cell.



When oxygen is present (aerobic conditions), pyruvate is normally transported into the mitochondria where it can enter the TCA cycle generating free electrons which are captured by NAD+ as NADH. NADH delivers these electrons to the electron transport chain and  oxidative phosphorylation results in the production of 34 molecules of ATP per glucose and regenerates NAD+.



While cancer cells generally have functional mitochondria, they utilize glycolysis to extract energy even under aerobic conditions. This constant cycling of glycolysis results in excessive production of lactate, which undergoes bulk transport out of the cell.



This phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis, also referred to as aerobic lactate production, in cancer cells is known as the Warburg Effect.


Image result for aerobic glycolysis cancer cells


But, why might aerobic glycolysis be beneficial to a cancer cell?


Hypothesized Potential Benefits of the Warburg Effect


Hypothesis
Explanation
Observations	Evidence Against This Hypothesis
ATP Hypothesis
Cancer Cells increase their access to energy by increasing the rate of ATP synthesis.	
The rate of ATP synthesis is higher in glycolysis than in oxidative phosphorylation.


Although the amount of ATP generated per glucose is lower in glycolysis (2 ATP), glycolysis generates ATP much faster than the slow, but efficient, process of oxidative phosphorylation (34 ATP) in the mitochondria.
	
ATP is not a limiting factor for growth and other ATP production pathways would be effective. 

Tumors also do not have an endless supply of glucose. 
Biosynthesis Hypothesis
By blocking the TCA cycle and increasing the flux through glycolysis, a cancer cell is able to generate more glycolytic intermediates that can be used for biosynthetic branch pathways. These branch pathways generate key molecules necessary for cell division.
Cancer cells show an increase in the pentose shunt, which produces ribose and NADPH.


They also show increased levels of serine and glutamine production, as well as higher levels of lipid precursors and GSH (a tripeptide that regulates REDOX reactions by dimerizing and accepting electrons).

Bulk export of lactate is an inefficient, wasteful use of carbon.


Regenerating NAD+ via lactate production does not create a net gain of NAD+. 


Many important biosynthetic pathways actually require substrates from the TCA cycle. 
Tumor Microenvironment Selection Hypothesis
As lactate is exported out of cancer cells, it reduces the pH of the surrounding tissue, resulting in tissue destruction.


Additionally, rapid import of glucose and glutamine (another molecule burned by tumor cells for energy), removes these molecules from surrounding tissues, effectively starving T cells and preventing immune infiltration.

Lower pH results in tissue disruption, which increases expression of HIF-1a. HIF-1a regulates genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, and progression through the cell cycle.


Lower extracellular glucose  levels are correlated with lower levels of T cell infiltration of a tumor.

The Warburg Effect is thought to be an early step in cancer development; it occurs very early in melanoma and pancreatic cancers even before a tumor mass has been formed. 


Aerobic glycolysis has also been found in unicellular organisms, such as yeast, even when they are isolated from the environment. 
Signaling Hypothesis
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced as a result of aerobic glycolysis alter the acetylation of chromatin, modulating gene expression.
When there is no shuttling into  mitochondria, the REDOX state of the cell is altered. This affects levels of ROS and levels of acetyl coA, resulting in decreases in histone acetylation. 
One of the main issues with this hypothesis is that signaling based on the state of glycolysis to other cellular activities lacks specificity.



So, if there is evidence against each “direct” mechanism, what is the best explanation of the potential benefits of the Warburg Effect to cancer cells?



Alternative “indirect” hypotheses provide an additional explanation:

Perhaps the Warburg Effect is secondary to mutations in p53 or other signaling pathways
P53 has been shown to regulate key metabolic genes
Thus, it is impossible to separate cell signaling and metabolic pathways
Or, perhaps the Warburg Effect is secondary to the increased activity of a novel metabolic pathway

In order to discover which hypothesis/combination of hypotheses best explains why the Warburg Effect is beneficial to cancer, further research into the emerging hallmark of modified energetics is cancer is required. 

H7C: Glutamine and Serine/Glycine Metabolism
This section will cover the metabolism of glutamine, and serine/glycine. These pathways are vital to cell processes, and they are shifted in important ways in cancerous conditions. 

Glutamine Metabolism
While glucose metabolism is the primary energy source in normally functioning cells, cancerous cells with increased energy demands rely heavily on alternative metabolic pathways like glutamine oxidation (Simabuco et al., 2018).

Glutamine is taken into cells and converted to glutamate
Reaction catalyzed by glutaminase
Glutamate is converted to alpha-ketoglutarate 
Reaction catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
Alpha-ketoglutarate is converted to malate within the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle
In cancerous conditions, the TCA cycle is not running normally because the electron transport chain is not replenishing electron carriers. So instead of driving the cycle fully, the alpha-ketoglutarate is converted to malate.
Malate exits the TCA cycle and exits the mitochondria
Malate is converted to pyruvate
Pyruvate is converted to...
Lactate
Lactic acid cycle is favored due to Warburg effect
Conversion to lactate produces valuable NADPH and also glutathione (GSH), which is important in controlling oxidative stress (Simabuco et al., 2018)
OR Acetyl-CoA
Can be used to drive lipid synthesis, which is vital for rapidly dividing cells that need to produce sufficient phospholipids to build their rapidly expanding plasma and organelle membranes
Glutamine metabolism is also an essential source of amino acids which are in high demand in rapidly reproducing cells

Figure description: The blue arrows show glutamine entering the cell and eventually entering the TCA cycle as a-KG. This can then be transformed into malate (follow the circle) which can exit as pyruvate, converting NADP+ to NADPH in the process. The pyruvate can then be used to create lactate or acetyl CoA (follow the blue arrows up and down).

Increased glutamine metabolism is important within cancer cells because…

Increased NADPH and GSH production
More pyruvate→acetyl CoA →lipid production→membranes for new cells
Increased amino acid production

Glutamine synthesis is the context of cancer is still not very well understood, as we know that it influences the factors listed above, but it also stimulates p53 which in turn stimulates glutaminase enzymes. The relationship between glutamine and cancer is complicated as it involves contradictory relationships with both oncogenes and tumor suppressors, but scientists believe that better understanding of how glutamine synthesis affects and is affected by cancer could improve research and cancer therapies. (Kim and Kim, 2013).

Serine/Glycine Metabolism
The production of serine and glycine are biosynthetically linked, and the hyperactivation of their production pathway is known to drive oncogenesis (Ameilo et al., 2014).

Glycolysis produces 3-Phosphoglycerate, a glycolytic intermediate
3-Phosphoglycerate can be converted to serine 
Reaction catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH)
PHGDH is often upregulated in cancerous cells leading to increased serine production
Serine can be converted to glycine
Both serine and glycine are known to be precursors for phosplipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and GSH (the oxidative stress controller also produced in glutamine metabolism) (Simabuco et al., 2018)


Figure description: This figure shows how PHGDH is involved in converting 3-phosphoglycerate eventually into serine (the horizontal pathway) and then into glycine which aids in nucleotide biosynthesis.

Increased PHGDH and there increased serine/glycine is important for cancerous cells because...

Increased phospholipid production→membranes for replicating cells
Increased nucleic acid production→genetic material for genome replication
Increased protein building blocks→increased ability to build proteins for cell growth/survival
Increased GSH production→control of oxidative stress


H7D: Entanglement of Cellular Signaling and Metabolic Pathways

In previous hallmarks, we’ve seen how alterations in cellular signaling pathways can promote oncogenic transformation and survival of cancerous cells. In the last section, we covered some of the major metabolic alterations observed in cancer cells. Here, we will cover how these alterations in cellular signaling and metabolic pathways are related.

Cellular signaling pathways and metabolic pathways do not act in isolation. Rather, these pathways are entangled to enable the cell to behave according to the information encoded in its energetic environment and modify its metabolism to meet energetic demands. Metabolic pathways are regulated by p53, onco-proteins, and other signaling pathways:

p53

p53 is a central regulatory molecule. Not only does p53 regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and genomic integrity, it also regulates dozens of key metabolic enzymes, some of which are shown in the figure below:

The Warburg Effect involves increased glycolytic flux, increased fatty acid synthesis, and decreased TCA flux and oxidative phosphorylation. As a tumor suppressor, p53’s regulatory actions generally favor the opposite of what we observe in the Warburg Effect.

p53’s precise effects depend on its phosphorylation state, but generally comprise:

Activation of fatty acid metabolism
Activation of TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
Activation of amino acid metabolism
Activation of ROS control
Inhibition of glycolysis

A mutation in p53 can disrupt its ability to regulate these processes. Metabolic flux may then shift to favor glucose metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, amino acid synthesis, loss of ROS control, and nucleotide synthesis (the Warburg Effect). More than half of human cancers have p53 mutations, so while p53 is important, there’s certainly more to the story.  

Oncogenes and Glutamine Metabolism

As we saw earlier, cancer cells use high amounts of glutamine for energy, purine synthesis, membrane lipid synthesis, and regulation of redox balance through GSH. Oncoproteins, such as mTOR, KRAS, and Myc, are known to activate aminotransferase, an enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism, thus supporting the ability of cancer cells to take in and use so much glutamine. A summary of the effects of oncogenes on glutamine metabolism is provided in the table below:

In short, the activation of oncogenes and growth signaling pathways triggers the metabolic changes necessary to meet the anabolic demands of rapid proliferation.

Insulin Receptor

High blood [glucose] stimulates the secretion of insulin, which signals for cells to uptake glucose and activates growth signaling pathways. The insulin receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that signals through RAS and PI3K pathways to: (a) promote the insertion of GLUT (glucose transporters) into cell membranes, and (b) signal for growth and proliferation. These changes promote the Warburg Effect and oncogenic transformation. The insulin receptor is reported to be overactive in many cancers. An overview of the insulin receptor pathway is provided below:

AMPK and mTOR

AMPK (AMP-dependent kinase) is activated when the ratio of cytoplasmic [ATP]:[AMP] drops below normal levels. mTOR is a protein involved in the PI3K growth signaling pathway. AMPK activates p53 and inhibits mTOR, thus suppressing growth and inhibiting anabolic pathways when energy status is poor. Loss of AMPK function and activation of mTOR are common events in cancer, promoting the Warburg Effect and proliferation. The relationship between AMPK, p53, and mTOR is provided in the figure below:


Integrated Stress Response via ATF4

Cells can be exposed to many different stress signals, such as those associated with oxidative stress, ER stress, and nutrient deprivation. To coordinate a survival-promoting response, these signals must be integrated. ATF4 serves this purpose, acting as a point of divergence for the integrated stress response (ISR).

ATF4 is induced by glucose, serine, or glutamine deprivation. The actions of ATF4 are very broad, and highly context-dependent. ATF4 can activate autophagy genes, stimulate PI3K pathway, activate apoptosis inhibitors (IAPs), promote apoptosis through CHOP/Bcl-2 family proteins, and modify miRNA and gene expression profiles. Generally, if a cell is stressed beyond repair, ATF4 will promote apoptosis. If survival is attainable, ATF4 will promote survival. Cancer cells upregulate ATF4 and selectively exploit its pro-survival effects. By upregulating ATF4, cancer cells can mimic a glucose/serine/glutamine-deprived state, inducing responses that further promote uptake of these nutrients and contribute to the Warburg Effect. The figure below summarizes the ISR and the role of ATF4:

HIF1α

Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF1α) is, as its name suggests, activated in hypoxic conditions. HIF1α stimulates the transcription of glycolysis genes and angiogenic factors, promoting the Warburg Effect. Cancer cells develop mechanisms of activating HIF1α, even in normoxic conditions. One possible mechanism is through the overexpression or mutation of IDH1/2, which is the subject of our journal article, to be discussed on the following page.

Summary

Cellular signaling pathways and metabolic pathways are closely linked through cross-regulation. Abnormalities in cell signaling can compromise the regulation of metabolic pathways. Consequently, altered cell energetics can promote oncogenic transformation and the proliferation of cancer cells. Understanding the entanglements of these pathways can help us identify promising targets for cancer therapies.

Discussion 

PATHWAY SUMMARY (image created by Nick) 



MAJOR CONCLUSIONS

Wild-type IDH2 is up-regulated in lung cancer and performs a function similar to mutant IDHs. 

Wild-type IDH2 decreased the intracellular ⍺-ketoglutarate to promote the Warburg effect and cell growth. 

Mediated by increasing HIF1⍺ protein expression 

HIF1⍺ inhibited PDH by activating PDKs to decrease the flux of pyruvate to the TCA cycle. 

LDHA transcriptionally activated HIF1⍺ → more lactate produced from pyruvate


Function of wild-type IDH2 relies more on the effect of ⍺-KG rather than 2-HG or ROS. 

2-HG may be produced by LDHA or MDH1/2

Reduction of ⍺-KG by wild-type IDH2 might have an oncogenic effect in lung tumorigenesis 

AMPK/ ⍺-KG axis dynamically regulates differentiation of progenitor cells 

IDH2 expression is the highest in poorly differentiated cells 

IDH2 expression highest in large cell carcinoma (LCC) 

Wild-type IDH2 might inhibit lung cancer cell differentiation through ⍺-KG-dependent dioxygenases 


Treatment of cells with AGI-6780 reduced IDH2 activity and decreased cellular viability and proliferation. 

Replenishing cellular ⍺-KG had the same effect. 

New strategy for treatment of lung cancer. 

AGI-6780 (inhibitor of IDH2) + PX-478 (inhibitor of HIF1⍺) + Replenishing cellular ⍺-KG 


UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

Is the role and mechanism of IDH2 reversed in different types of cancer? (see Table 1)

What is the effect of confounding variables, like gender and smoking status, on the public datasets that were used in this paper?

What is the clinical significance of using IDH inhibitors in human trials? 

Could these drugs have harmful side effects?

In cases of metastatic cancer, could IDH inhibitors be tumor suppressive in some tissues, but tumor-promoting in others?

Why did the authors only focus on one isoform of IDH? 


Late Events
The road to cancer does not end when normal cells have been transformed into cells that can grow into a clinically important tumor. The transformed cells undergo a set of interconnected activities that collectively lead to the clinically important stages of the disease that we can observe.

The sub-pages within this section describe how transformed cells grow to form a clinically detectable mass, and how they recruit other cells to assist in that process. To form a large mass, the tumor must create a new blood supply through angiogenesis. Finally, tumor cells begin moving out from their primary mass and seeding new sites. This process of metastasis is the main mechanism by which most tumors kill their hosts.

LE1. Multistep Tumorigenesis
Which of the Many Changes in Cancer Cells Leads to Tumor Formation?
The seven hallmark changes we have discussed are essential steps in a process by which normal cells become transformed. Yet the end goal of cancer research is not just to identify the individual changes, but connect them together into a coherent model or view of cancer as a disease process. 

Even after transformation, these cells do not constitute a tumor. We do not (as yet) understand the process of tumorigenesis (how transformed cells develop into a clinically detectable mass that affects health) nearly as thoroughly as we understand how the individual changes occur that are described in the Hallmarks pages. Moreover, our view of tumorigenesis has evolved over time as our knowledge of the Hallmarks has changed.

The table below outlines some ways in which it has evolved.

Time 
Epidemiological Evidence

Molecular Evidence
Prior to 1900s
	Observational hypotheses of tumorigenesis based on incidence clusters

No molecular data available
1900-1950s 	Evidence coming in from toxicology, infectious disease studies; 2-step model emerges
	Carcinogens, disease agents identified. No unifying mechanism yet.
1950-1990s 	Statistical models suggest multi-step model combines random mutation, fixed series of events
	First oncogenes; multi-step model requires "genetics only"
Late 1990s-today
	Better data suggest many causes interacting with one another
	Circuits, networks-based; process includes strong selection
What Else Do We Know?
What can we say we know with certainty about how transformed cells become the large solid clinically significant tumor we think of as cancer?
1. We Know Tumorigenesis is Slow, and Age-Related
As national organizations have collected data on the incidence of different cancers, statisticians looking at the epidemiological began seeing clear trends. First, cancer incidence rises with age. Second, we can see a delay between when people are exposed to a suspected carcinogenic agent or event, and when disease appears. These observations suggest that, regardless of the mechanisms causing individual changes to cells,  the full process occurs slowly over many years.
2. We Know Tumorigenesis Requires Multiple Changes to Cells
There is ample experimental evidence from cell and animal studies to support this statement. We ALSO see it in the epidemiological data.

The incidence curve for cancer has a characteristic lag, followed by a sharp increase after age 45.  By modeling the shape of this curve we can estimate how many cell changes are needed for tumorigenesis.

Imagine that tumors develop because of a single mutational event, and that the probability of that mutation is stable at 5% per 5 years.
Probability in the first 5 years of life is 5% above baseline, or 1.05.
In the second 5 years of life, probability goes up by 5% again, then another 5% by age 15, and so on.
In this case, there should be a simple probability relationship between tumor formation and age, as shown in the top right panel below.
Now suppose tumorigenesis occurs as a result of TWO age-related events:
The probability curve for tumors developing is the multiplication product of TWO separate probabilities.
BOTH probabilities are relative to age, so the final probability of both events occurring should resemble a curve of (age)2 vs. time.
If tumors develop due to THREE age-related events, the curve should have a similar shape as   (age)3 vs. time, and so on.


Unlike rodents, the exact number of events needed to create human tumor cells depends on the mutation, cell type, location, and other factors. GENERALLY though, incidence for most human tumors match a predicted curve for 5-7 mutational changes. No doubt other mutations are important, but this seems to be the minimum requirement for most human tumors.
3. We Know Each Human Tumorigenic Mutation Has Multiple Effects
We know from studying human tumor cells that each mutation affects multiple paths and circuits. For example, inactivation of p53:

Prevents tumor cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to irreparable DNA damage. 
Contributes to uncontrolled growth and immortalization.
Is partly why tumor cells switch to aerobic glycolysis (not shown below).

There Are Three General Models of Tumorigenesis
Three models of tumorigenesis predominate the literature. There is evidence to support as well as refute all three models. Even if we assume one is more likely than the others (as I do,) it is helpful to know the basic assumptions of each model, if for no other reason than to be able to understand the occasional random references authors make to one of the models from time to time.
1. Clonal Expansion Model: Clean and Tidy, but Too Simple?
Early work on steps in tumorigenesis was done in colon cancer, largely because colon tumors could be observed directly over time, and passed through clearly defined stages.  Early genotype mapping found a clear sequence of mutations that corresponded to different stages of tumor development.

Initial epithelial overgrowth (hyperplasia) consistently occurred when a gene in q arm of Chromosome 5 was mutated. Later work found the APC gene at this locus.
Development of the raised polyp (adenoma) co-occurred with the appearance of a K-Ras mutation, and a second LOH event in q arm of Chromosome 18.
Carcinoma did not develop or begin to invade surrounding tissues until there was mutation of the p arm of Chromosome 17, later found to be p53.

As more gene and genome mapping studies were done, it became clear that many colon cancers fit this model, but not all. Instead, it appeared that, at least for colon cancer, there are 4+ circuits that need to be altered, but that the specific mutation is not as important.

The earliest mutation inactivates enterocyte growth control by de-regulating Wnt/APC/beta catenin.
Subsequent mutations could create constitutively active KRas, or affect one of its signaling intermediates.
The LOH event at Chr. 18q alters TGF-beta signaling (part of EMT)
Loss of p53 is common, but mutations in p53 regulators are equally effective.



Prior studies already had suggested that tumors are monoclonal masses. This and the evidence shown above led many in the field to think all tumor cells form through simple clonal expansion.

One cell develops a mutation and expands to become the main cell type in the population.
A second mutation occurs in one cell. If it is a "driver mutation" that accelerates cells growth, cells with that mutation take over the population.
The process repeats several times. Each time, cells with driver mutations that accelerate tumor cell growth take over.
"Passenger mutations" may appear but they are neutral, and are carried along without benefit or cost.

The clonal expansion model is appealing because it fits nicely with our power relationship model; as we age, each of the required mutations has a greater probability of occurring, and these mutations accumulate over time.  It helps explain why developing tumor cells enter blast crisis (see the pages on telomeres for more.)  Clonal expansion also fits our observations of the mutations linked to stages of colon cancer described above.

One problem with the clonal expansion model is that it requires each mutation to accelerate growth or benefit survival in some way, otherwise other cells would outgrow mutant cells. This mechanism also does not explain more recent findings showing  tumors are not monoclonal masses. This model may explain some tumorigenic progessions, but is not enough to explain them all.
2. Cancer Stem Cell Model: Fits Many Observations, but Leaves Gaps
As more tumors were sequenced, three important discoveries were made. First, tumors are not monoclonal. There are sub-populations within the tumor cell population. One genotype tends to dominate, but others are present.   Second, similar tumors in patients with similar histories may have very different genotypes. The panel below shows the chromosomal translocations and rearrangements for two patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The two tumors are similar stages despite have greatly different chromosomal reorganization patterns. Clearly, one sequence of events is not needed for all tumor types.
Third, tumors that metastasize from a primary mass can have a different genotype than their original primary mass. One prediction of clonal expansion is that if tumor cells are all a single genotype, then all cells should be equally capable of forming metastases. Two experiments showed  that this is untrue.

The first study separated metastatic human breast carcinoma cells into four populations based on two surface markers. Under clonal expansion, these sub-populations should not exist. Yet when they were injected into SCID mice, cells with levels of cell-cell adhesion marker but low B-cell activation potential formed tumors successfully, while 100-fold more cells with high B-cell activation potential failed to form a tumor.

In a similar experiment, tumor cells were found to express high levels of cell surface markers that are normally found only on embryonic and adult stem cells.
These and many other observations led many in the cancer biology field to support an alternative model of tumor cell formation: cancer stem cells. According to this view of tumor cell formation, the majority of tumor cells in a mass may not be capable of unlimited proliferation. Instead, adult stem cells undergo mutation, and then expand into larger populations through NORMAL cell turnover processes.

Additional mutations in the expanded populations are detectable, but ultimately less important for tumor development; only the mutations in the small population of stem cells get passed along to all progeny cells. Eventually one stem cell develops all mutations needed and becomes the source for the cells that dominate the tumor and spread by metastasis.

Cancer stem cells are an appealing model for many reasons:

They explain why aggressively metastatic cells have stem cell surface markers.
The model fits our observations that tumors contain a mixture of genotypes.
Slow turnover of cancer stem cells could explain delayed recurrence after treatment.
They explain some features of metastasis.

Cancer stem cells do not explain some other features of cancer:

How does the pre-tumor stem cell overcome the innate slow turnover rate?
Why do they undergo blast crisis?

3. The "Evolving Ecosystem" Model: Best of Both?
Evidence is accumulating to suggest BOTH the monoclonal expansion and cancer stem cells models may be partly right, but that NEITHER is sufficient on its own to explain tumorigenesis.

What is emerging is what I call an "evolving ecosystem view." This is not a generally used or accepted term, but it does appear in some reviews. This phrase summarizes the main driving forces within the model. The evolving ecosystem view does not force us to choose between clonal expansion and cancer stem cells. Instead, it brings both paths to tumors together in a larger explanatory model.

Briefly:

Tumors are like ecosystems in the sense they are defined environments where populations of different cell types exist. (They are not separate species, though we can think of them that way.)
Some of the different cell types are sub-populations of tumor cells. These may be generated by clonal expansion, stem cell paths, or a combination of both.
There are populations of other cells within the tissue (fibroblasts, immune cells, etc.) too.
The tumor environment is NOT a hospitable one. There is STRONG negative selection against tumor cells that are not well adapted to the conditions.
Strong selection reduces the population of tumor cells to a small number of genotypes. One or two genotypes dominate, but other genotypes are still present.
When conditions within the tumor space change, one population that was favored previously may be replaced by a different genotype. As different sub-populations grow and decline, the overall tumor environment changes and evolves.

This view of tumor formation is better aligned with our current understanding of cancer genetics. We know now that genotype alone does not determine how tumor cells behave. Instead, tumor cell genotype interacts with pre-existing internal conditions and external changes over time. The combination is what determines cancer cell phenotype, and in turn how the tumor develops.
This view of tumorigenesis has other advantages.

It helps explain why some mutations appear to be "passengers." These are not neutral mutations, but rather,  unselected variation in a population of cells that arose from strongly selected predecessor cells. As conditions change, former passenger mutations may become essential for survival.
We do not have to explain tumorigenesis using mutations in tumor cells alone. In this view we can incorporate heterotypic cell interactions between tumor cells and their neighboring cells.
Treating tumors as complex environments with many sub-populations of tumor cells helps explain many of the cellular behaviors we see when tumors metastasize.  

Why Know All Three Models/Views?
As was stated above, the process of tumorigenesis is extremely complex, and does not occur through one specific set of steps. Different tumor types develop in different ways. Nevertheless, a general model can help us organize and better understand the specific details. 

There is no need to choose between these three models. Rather, treat them as three different ways of organizing observations. At some point in the future someone may find there is a single unifying model of tumorigenesis, though I doubt that will happen. Cancer is not a single disease, but a family of related diseases that share some features. It seems logical that tumors develop in more than one way.

LE2. Tumor-Tissue Interactions
Tumors are NOT Just a Mass of Transformed Cells

Depending on the tissue and location, the lower size limit for a clinically detectable tumor is about 900 mm3, or a sphere about the size of a single cooked garden pea. This mass is not uniform though; the tumor will have a mix of transformed tumor cells, immune cells (mainly lymphocytes and macrophages), fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, and microvessels. How much of each cell type will be present depends on the tumor cell type.

For example, the sections through the tumors below  show that transformed cells can make up as little as 1% of all cells in a Hodgkin's lymphoma mass, with most of the balance consisting of lymphocytes. Even within the same type of tumor, the fractions vary. The middle and right panels below both show breast carcinomas. In the middle panel, light blue-stained collagen and fibroblasts make up ~60% of the total visible material. In the right panel, the black-stained collagen makes up less of the total tumor mass (~30%), and tumor cells, much more of the mass. The difference in cell composition between the two breast tumors will in turn affect how they progress, how likely they are to metastasize, and overall prognosis and survival of the patient.
Why Are Other Cells Present in a Tumor Mass?
From experiments we know that tumor cells taken from mice are fully capable of forming new tumors in other mice. Human tumor cells differ in they require additional support cells or extracellular materials to colonize new sites successfully.

The experiment summarized below shows that, if an immortalized line of human mammary epithelial carcinoma (txHMEC) cells is injected into immuno-deficient SCID mice, only 52% of injections produce tumors. Moreover, the tumors take 70 days to establish and grow to significant size.

If the same cells are injected into mice mixed with Matrigel, 100% of injections form tumors, the tumors form more quickly, and grow approximately 25% larger.

Matrigel is the trade name for a gel-like protein mixture secreted by Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma cells into their culture medium. The purified mix is produced and sold by Corning Life Sciences and BD Biosciences. It contains laminin, collagen, nidogen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, thus resembling the basement membranes which epithelial cells anchor to and migrate on or through. All of these molecules can signal through pro-survival cell adhesion receptors on epithelial cells. Matrigel also contains TGF-beta and EGF that stimulate growth and prevent differentiation.

The greatest development occurs when txHMEC cells are co-injected with human fibroblasts (which incidentally, are similar to the EHS cells and produce part of the normal basement membranes.)  Again, 100% of injections form tumors, but:

Tumors are established in half the time of injections containing Matrigel
Tumors reach maximum size twice as fast, and
Final tumor volume is nearly twice what txHMEC cells can form on their own.


From this and many other studies it has been well-established that most transformed tumor cells in humans communicate and interact extensively with:

Their neighboring cells, especially fibroblasts
Immune cells, either residing in tissues or that have been attracted to the tumor site
The molecules contained in the extracellular matrix in which they reside and
Nearby circulatory and lymphatic micro-vessels.

The schematic below outlines how these cells and non-cellular structures interact.

Growing Tumors Resemble Abnormal Wound-Healing Sites
As cancer biologists tried to understand tumor development, it soon was obvious that the process was not unique. Most of the molecules and interactions also are found in wounds, and so the process of tumor growth is usually described as a "defective wound process," or "a wound that won't heal."
What is the Normal Wound Healing Process?
Normal wounds go through four overlapping phases, outlined in the schematic and flow diagrams below.
The initial injury (a cut in the illustration above) triggers platelet degranulation, which releases PDGF and TGF-beta into the local environment. Blood clotting seals the damaged vessel, which limits the amount of PDGF/TGF-beta released to what the now-degranulated platelets contained. At the same time, tissue and cell damage generates DAMPs that initiate inflammation locally and attract macrophages.

Released PDGF/TGF-beta stimulate several simultaneous processes.

PDGF:
Further stimulates macrophages attracted by the DAMPs and inflammation.
Stimulates proliferation and migration of fibroblasts into the site to rebuild the stromal matrix.
TGF-beta:
Stimulates the overlying epithelium to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a shift in phenotype that allows the epithelium cells to proliferate and migrate to cover the wound site.
Stimulates fibroblasts to secrete VEGF (important in vessel repair), and extracellular matrix molecules including collagen.
Stimulates fibroblasts to form contractile fibers. These myo-fibroblasts bind to the wound edges, and pull them together.

The macrophages that have been attracted to the site:

Use matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to break down and reorganize the ECM. Many of the molecules created by MMP breakdown of ECM will help regulate blood vessel repair.
Synthesize and secrete additional VEGF.

Accumulated VEGF triggers endothelial cells to proliferate and finish sealing the damaged vessel. If the repaired tissue needs new vessels, VEGF stimulates branching angiogenesis.

As the wound begins to close:

The epithelium is no longer stimulated by TGF-beta, so reverts back to its original phenotype by reversing the EMT process (i.e., MET, or mesenchymal to epithelial transition.)
Without PDGF:
Fibroblast growth stops.
Matrix breakdown by macrophages slows down. As inflammation clears, macrophages migrate back out of the tissue or stay and become inactive.

Tumor Cells Overload Normal Wound Healing Processes
Many tumor cells constitutively produce PDGF and TGF-beta, even though they are epithelial cells. The schematic below outlines how this overloads normal repair. It creates a permanent state of disorganized tissue breakdown, growth, and re-vascularization.

This abnormal wound response creates three important features of tumors. First, excess and chronic stimulation of fibroblasts and myo-fibroblasts by TGF-beta causes excess secretion of collagen and other fibrous proteins into extracellular matrix. Second, myo-fibroblasts pull tissue together so it is more dense than normal. This abnormally dense desmoplastic stroma feels significantly stiffer and harder than the normal stromal matrix, and is why many tumors feel like hard lumps or masses within their surrounding tissues. 
Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)  that are over-stimulated with PDGF, TGF-beta, etc., also synthesize and secrete an abnormal extracellular matrix that supports a larger network of microvessels feeding the tumor. 

The Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
Clinically, EMT may be one of the most important processes in cancer.  Mutations create a variety of abnormal genotypes, but if tumor cells do not undergo this change, they cannot invade adjacent tissues or metastasize to new locations.

A normal sheet of epithelial cells has a series of cell-cell connections that bind the individual cells to the adjacent epithelial cells to form a single functional unit. There are multiple types of connections linking cells of the same type, including tight junctions, gap junctions, and adherens junctions.

Adherens junctions are important both for maintaining cell attachments, and for providing information about other nearby cells. Epithelial cells almost universally express E-cadherins on their cell surfaces. E-cadherins allow epithelial cells to recognize other epithelial cells and automatically organize in sheets or layers.
The panel above shows how E-cadherins (yellow fluorescence) connects a sheet of epithelial cells together.  Epithelial cells must break these connections before they can proliferate or leave the sheet. During a normal wound signaling cascade, TGF-beta down-regulates the E-cadherins, and replaces them with N-cadherin proteins. So long as epithelial cells produce N-cadherins, they cannot attach to other cells that bear E-cadherins. Also, cells expressing N-cadherins form very loose attachments to adjacent cells, and migrate readily. 
The shift from E- to N-cadherins is one of several well defined changes that TGF-beta stimulates. The chart below summarizes them. In a normal wound response, this EMT transition is temporary, and the epithelial cells return to producing E-cadherins once the wound is closed (MET transition).
Tumor cells differ in they over-produce TGF-beta and other growth factors so cannot recycle back; they are more or less permanently locked in a state of continuous stimulation to grow and migrate.
Which Is More Important: EMT or Oncogenes?
Several experiments suggest that chronic EMT cannot replace mutant over-activated oncogenes as the main driver of tumor cell growth. What chronic EMT does is reduce or eliminate the INTER-cellular and cell-matrix interactions that can limit tumor cell growth and migration. Tumor cells still need their internal oncogenes to drive growth.

Additional information about how EMT contributes to metastasis is on the page describing how and where tumor cells spread.

LE3. Angiogenesis

All tissues require 4 types of micro-vessels (vessels smaller than 100 um in cross-section):

Arterioles are the last muscular vessels before capillaries. The smallest arterioles may consist of just endothelium and one layer of vascular smooth muscle. Arterioles constrict and relax in response to both circulating hormones and autonomic innervation. By doing this, arterioles control overall blood pressure, and regulate which capillary beds receive blood flow.

Venules are low pressure counterparts to arterioles. They connect capillaries back to the larger veins that transport blood back to the heart. Venules have some smooth muscle, but also larger internal diameter. Blood flows in them at lower pressure than in arterioles. 

Capillaries are the smallest vessels containing blood cells. Most capillaries have an internal diameter of just 8-10 um, barely large enough for erythrocytes to pass through them. On average, normal cells in the human body are never further than 7 cell diameters away from one or more capillaries.

The figure below shows their normal structure. 
A capillary wall consists of just a thin continuous layer of flat endothelial cells (stained green in the image above, and transmission electron micrograph), and a thin layer of basement membrane. 
Scattered along the capillaries are structural support cells called pericytes. (Red in left panel, an arrows in the right panel below mark pericytes.)


Lymphatic vessels do not connect directly to the circulatory system. The smallest lymph vessels (stained red in the image at the top of the page) have a single layer of endothelium like vascular capillaries, but are larger in internal diameter.
Lymphatic vessels are porous. Excess inter-cellular fluid (also called interstitial fluid) is pushed into the lymph vessels by body movement.
Lymph fluid travels through lymph vessels to lymph nodes. Each node contains hundreds of microscopic clonal colonies of B- and T-cells. As lymph fluid moves from node to node,  lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells monitor it for foreign antigens.

Normal Angiogenesis
In normal tissues, growth of new micro-vessels is tightly regulated by a balance of multiple factors summarized below.

The signaling cascade can be activated one of two ways: by direct injury to the microvessels (such as by a cut), or by tissue hypoxia that activates specific signaling paths.

Side note:  contact lens wearers more than 30-40 years old often must give up their lenses when microscopic blood vessels begin to invade the white portion of the eye. Ocular angiogenesis is triggered when the cornea becomes hypoxic; this is more likely to occur as we age. Vessels in the white sclera are cosmetically unappealing, but are just the first step. Left untreated, small vessels continue growing until they invade the clear cornea, blocking vision. This outcome is rare, as most opticians will stop prescribing contact lenses to patients who have microvessels growing towards their corneas. When users stop wearing contacts, the vessels regress once more.

Hypoxic zones (areas in which tissue oxygen levels are lower than normal) form routinely between microvessels. The illustration below left shows living tissue with the capillaries stained green, and hypoxic tissues between the capillaries stained red. The panel below right shows how oxygen concentration in tissues reaches its lowest point mid-way between two capillaries. As a consequence, the tissue switches temporarily to anaerobic glycolysis and produces lactic acid. pH goes down, and ATP production drops. 


Transient hypoxia occurs frequently in working tissues, and is corrected by shifting more blood flow to the affected capillary beds. If this is not sufficient to correct hypoxia, the process of new vessel growth begins. The process is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) transcription factor by the path shown below.



During normoxia, tissues produce von-HIppel Lindau factor (pVHL), a tumor suppressor protein that transports HIF-1a to the proteasome for degradation. When  cells are hypoxic (or injured) pVHL is modified so it no longer binds to HIF-1a. The un-bound transcription factor moves into the nucleus, binds to a co-factor (HIF-1b), and activates genes associated with synthesis and secretion of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and other pro-angiogenic factors. Once hypoxia is relieved, pVHL again transports HIF-1a to the proteasome for degradation.
VEGF binds to VEGF receptors on the surface of endothelial cells of nearby capillaries, and stimulates them to divide and to migrate towards the source of VEGF, in this case, hypoxic cells. A solid sprouting mass of new endothelial cells pushes out towards the hypoxic zone, eventually connecting with other sprouting vessel branches. Once they touch and connect, both sprouts reorganize to form a single connecting microvessel. 

Initially these new microvessels are fragile and easily damaged. Shortly after they connect, the endothelial cells secrete small amounts of PDGF out into the surrounding tissues, which attracts pericytes to wrap and reinforce the outer face of the new capillaries (left, middle panels below, shown in red; endothelium is in green).
Pericytes have a bi-phasic response to PDGF. When levels are low, they proliferate and migrate toward the source, but when levels are high, they stop migration. In normal microvessel formation, pericytes do not perceive high levels of PDGF until they are directly next to the new endothelial cells; as a result, they stop just outside of the new vessels. If PDGF levels are too high, pericytes stop some distance from the endothelium and are unable to stabilize the new vessels.

Tumor Angiogenesis is NOT Normal
As  a reminder, tumors produce high levels of TGF-beta and PDGF, which stimulates both tissue fibroblasts and macrophages to secrete higher than normal levels of VEGF. This stimulates new microvessel formation in the ABSENCE of hypoxia, through the paths shown below.

In addition to stimulating production and release of VEGF, tumor cells up-regulate their own normal pVHL/HIF-1a/hypoxia response, and stimulate the pathway in nearby cells. This further contributes to a "hypoxia-like state" that stimulates new vessel growth.

As the figure below shows, microvessels that form in tumor tissues are very different from normal microvessels.
Key differences between normal and tumor microvessels:

Microvessels in normal tissue (above left) tend to form regularly organized networks within the inter-cellular spaces. Tumor microvessels (above right) are disorganized.
In normal tissues, capillaries are smaller in diameter than the arterioles and venules they interconnect.
In normal microvessels (below, left) vascular endothelial cells are tightly connected by extensive E-cadherins and other cell-cell connections. The endothelial layer of tumor microvessels is poorly organized with many large pores. This makes tumor microvessels leaky; both blood plasma proteins and cells can move in and out of these abnormal microvessels easily.
Tumor vessels are more fragile, because stabilizing pericytes do not migrate close enough to the capillaries to stabilize them. Instead, pericytes stop migrating before they reach capillaries.


The figure above shows the arrangement of endothelium in a normal capillary wall  (top left), versus endothelium of a microvessel in a tumor (top middle, right). The gaps between endothelial cells in tumor vessels allow large molecules and even cells to move into circulating blood from the tissue (as tumor cells do) or from blood to tissues. The lower 4 panels show how dextran blue-tagged blood proteins leak out of abnormal microvessels that grew in a mouse's ear after the ear was injected with tumor-derived growth factors. In a normal animal, the dye-labeled proteins would have stayed in the microvessels.
Angiogenesis Has a Complex Relationship With Metastasis
It was long thought that growth of poorly structured, leaky microvessels was the essential precursor step to metastasis. This assumption was the impetus for a decades-long search for angiogenesis inhibitors. It was thought that angiogenesis inhibitors could cut off the blood and nutrient supplies of a tumor, and thereby shut down the primary path for metastasis.  We now know that the relationship between angiogenesis and metastasis is much more complicated.

First, ill-formed and leaky capillaries ACCELERATE metastasis, but for some forms of cancer, they are not essential. Several studies have observed metastatic tumor cells can migrate in BOTH directions through normal, fully formed capillary endothelium.

Second, micro-metastases leave a primary mass very early in its growth; one study suggested that tumors may shed up to 1 million dormant micro-metastases before reaching a clinically detectable size. Inhibiting angiogenesis so early would be impractical if not impossible.

Third (and most surprising), clinical trials have reported that when human patients are given angiogenesis inhibitors, tumors regress initially then soon return.  Worse, post-inhibition tumors grow more aggressively at the primary site, and micro-metastases begin growing body-wide. Current evidence suggests that angiogenesis inhibitors targeting vascular capillary growth do not block growth by lymphatic micro-vessels. When capillary angiogenesis stops, hypoxic tumor cells:

Push further along the EMT transition continuum, changing to an aggressively growing state that migrates widely within local tissues.
Produce VEGF that stimulates growth of lymphatic vessels instead. These provide another path for the more aggressively mobile tumor cells to escape and disseminate to other tissues.


LE4. Metastasis
The final stage of cancer is metastasis, the spread of cells from the primary tumor site to other locations in the body. Approximately 90% of all cancer deaths are not due to the primary mass, but instead due to effects of metastasis.

The first hints that metastasis might be an active molecular process were published in the 1890s, but the initial idea was dismissed for nearly 100 years. For decades it was assumed that metastasis was a passive, largely random process. Where tumors disseminated could be explained entirely by physical mechanics of blood and lymphatic flow. We now know this is not the full story; tumors disseminate to other sites by more than one mechanism, and that there are active molecular signals and interactions at work.
Metastasis Begins With EMT
During primary tumor growth, tumor epithelial cells undergo the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; below). The same phenotypic changes that allow tumor cells to invade their surrounding tissues also allow them to invade into microvessels. 



After EMT, tumor cells are able to migrate freely, which facilitates intravasation, the process of entering vessels. The tumor cells also produce  matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the basement membrane surrounding capillaries and further facilitate intravasation.


Surviving the Trip
Other than blood cells, most normal cells cannot survive long in open circulation. This brings us to one of the enduring questions about metastasis: why don't circulating tumor cells die in transit? 

One argument is sheer numbers: tumors shed millions of cells over a several-year period; it is not surprising that some cells survive by chance. This explanation is unsatisfactory though, because we know from experimental animal studies that some tumor cells survive quite well in circulation.

Current evidence suggests that metastasizing cells avoid destruction several ways. The table below outlines the main threats, and how tumor cells might avoid them.

Threats in Transit

Details
Tumor Cell Survival Mechanisms
Anoikis	Anchorage-dependent cells die by a variant of apoptosis after a short time without surface support
	

EMT process makes tumor cells less susceptible to anoikis signal paths
Tumor cells can travel in small groups, reducing stress signals
Tumor cells can travel in aggregates with stromal fibroblasts, macrophages that provide support signals
Time spent in open circulation is very short

Flow shear

Fluid dynamics of blood flow generate forces great enough to rupture non-blood cells.

Cells entering capillaries esp. at risk of damage
	

Tumors trigger platelet aggregation; attached platelets shield tumor cell from shear forces.
Tumors shed most of cytoplasm and plasma membrane;  nucleus plus small piece of cytoplasm is shear-resistant.
Aggregates do not travel into capillaries; "park" in arterioles, grow until vessel ruptures.
Avoid open circulation by traveling in lymphatics.

Disrupted cell cycle
Cells do not continue cycle while in transit; will die if do not restart  
	

A few papers suggest traveling tumor cells enter a "Go dormancy state."

Immune attack

Circulating cells are open to innate, acquired immunity
	

Platelet aggregation around the tumor cells physically hides tumor cell from immune monitoring.
Tumor cells travel with tumor-assoc. macrophages & regulatory T-cells that regulate immune responses
Tumor cells over-express immune checkpoint blockers such as PD-1


Extravasation
Tumor cells must extravasate (exit from the circulation) when they invade new tissues. We know from studies of normal immune cells that neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes can complete the process in 30 minutes or so. Studies to determine how long tumor cells need to exit circulation have yielded conflicting results. Some tumor cells leave vessels relatively quickly.  For example, the images below show fluorescently labeled CHO tumor cells lodging and extravasating into the liver of a mouse. Injected tumor cells lodge in small capillaries (left panel) within minutes of injection. The right panel shows that CHO tumor cells can successfully move out of the vessels into adjacent tissue in as little as 24 hours.
Other studies (illustrated below) suggest that tumor cells co-migrating with platelets may extravasate more slowly. They appear to lodge in capillaries, trigger degranulation of the platelets, and form a clot plug. This seals the capillary and releases TGF-beta and PDGF that stimulate the local stroma to reorganize for angiogenesis, which facilitates tumor cell entry.

Still other tumor cells may not extravasate from the microvessels at all. Instead, a new clonal colony forms inside the vessel. The growing tumor cell mass eventually pushes out of the vessel into surrounding tissues.
What Determines Where Metastasizing Cells Go?
Current evidence suggests that:

66% (2/3) of extravasation sites are explained by vascular anatomy and flow patterns
34% (1/3) of extravasation sites are selected through molecular signaling events

Metastasis As a Result of Flow Characteristics
The graph above shows the primary sites of metastasis for the 12 most common human cancers. More than 60% of all metastases recorded in the graph go to these 5 locations:

~21% to lymph nodes within the tissues near the tumor
~13% to lymph nodes in other parts of the body
~12% to the liver
~11% to the lungs
~6% to bone marrow

The preference for local lymph nodes seems logical, given that lymphatic vessels provide a direct path from the interstitial spaces to nearby lymph nodes. The panel below (top left) shows the arrangement of lymph nodes within normal human breast. The top right panel shows how black tracer dye injected into a primary breast tumor (outside the photo) migrates to adjacent lymph nodes.  The bottom two panels show how breast carcinoma cells can colonize the node to form new tumors (arrows, bottom left). Most metastases will continue to express markers associated with the original tumor; in the lower right panel, the metastatic mass inside of the lymph node still expressed breast tumor cell markers (brown staining.)


Once tumor cells enter the lymphatic system, they can be carried to distant nodes under low-pressure, low-shear flow conditions.

The high rate of metastasis to lung, liver, and bone marrow can also be explained at least partly by blood flow patterns. The schematic below shows normal blood flow.

Blood from the gut collects in the portal vein and passes through the liver before continuing to the heart and lungs. Given this flow pattern it is not surprising that the liver is the most common site of metastasis for colorectal cancers.
By weight, the lungs receive the largest fractional blood flow of any organ (averaging 4.7 ml blood/g of organ mass.) The lungs also have an extensive capillary network. Given these features, it is not surprising that lungs are a primary site of metastasis for 9 out of the 12 most common forms of cancer.


Metastasis Cannot Be Explained JUST By Flow Characteristics
The table  below shows the primary organs of the body, sorted by decreasing fractional blood flow.
It is very easy to find inconsistencies that suggest sites of metastases are determined by more than just flow.

Given that the lungs have the greatest total and fractional blood flow, it is not surprising  that 9/12 of the most common human cancers metastasize to lungs. However, NONE of the 12 most common types of cancer in humans spread to the next 5 most flow-rich organs on the list.
Kidneys receive 64% of the fractional blood flow and 20% of the total blood flow that the lungs do, but they are rarely sites of metastasis.
Small intestine, large intestine, spleen, and heart all have high fractional flow, but rarely are sites of metastases.
Muscle is the largest organ by total mass, yet is not a site for metastasis.
The primary site of metastasis for lung cancer is the opposite lung, liver and adrenal glands.
The first highly vascularized organ downstream from the lungs is the heart, not the liver. Why does lung cancer not spread to the heart?
The adrenal gland receives negligible blood flow, yet is one of the 5 most common sites for lung metastases.
The opposite lung is a common site for lung metastases, but there is no direct vascular or lymphatic link; blood and lymph must pass through the entire body before returning.
Liver is the most common site of metastasis; 12/12 of the most common human cancers will spread there. Yet the liver does not receive a large fractional blood flow. Position in the circulation does not explain why it is a preferred site either.
Ovarian tumors spread to the abdominal peritoneum (adjacent tissue), but invade the liver far more frequently than lungs. Venous flow from the ovaries does not go into the hepatic portal system; it passes through the lungs first. Ovarian tumor cells traveling in blood must complete a full cycle of the body before they can reach the liver.
Tumors infrequently spread to other regions of the same organ. For example, colorectal cancer rarely spreads to other regions of the colon.

These and other studies suggest that some metastatic tumors "select" downstream sites by either a negative or positive molecular mechanism.
Molecular Exclusion and Selection Mechanisms
A word of warning: this is another ragged, raw edge of cancer biology. Like energetics, we are in an observational phase with hints of mechanisms, but no consensus yet on how (and how much) molecular interactions contribute to metastasis.

We can divide molecular selection mechanisms into two subgroups. Best estimates right now are that ~14% of sites are chosen by exclusion, that is, the downstream site is NOT colonized because it LACKS critical molecular signals. Molecular exclusion may help explain why it metastases in heart, kidneys, and some other organs are rare. Mechanisms underlying exclusion are still elusive.

There is more evidence to support that ~20% of sites are chosen or prepared by positive molecular compatibility effects. The earliest reference to molecular compatibility was Stephen Paget's "seed and soil" hypothesis, published in 1889. Paget observed that breast tumors that moved beyond lymph nodes consistently disseminated to specific organs and locations in the body. He suggested that metastatic cells are "seeds" that need a specific "soil" (conditions within target tissues) to colonize successfully.

Paget's original hypothesis did not gain much attention for many years. Its most glaring limitation is that "seed and soil" does not explain why tumors rarely disseminate to other regions of the same organ. For example, we might expect that the best "soil" for metastatic breast cancer would be the remaining breast. Yet breast tumors almost never spread to the other gland.

"Seed and soil" was revived in the 1980s, and subsequently expanded and refined. What Paget described as tissue "soil conditions" is what we now describe as the tumor micro-environment. Recent studies have documented several molecular processes that determine where and how tumor cells interact with sites of potential metastasis. Two of these processes are summarized here.
Molecular Priming Model
In molecular priming, the signaling environment tumor cells experience PRIOR to leaving the primary mass modifies the tumor cell phenotype so that it is more likely to colonize one site or another more successfully. One of the early experiments to demonstrate priming (Padua, 2008) looked at estrogen receptor negative human breast tumors, which can metastasize to either lungs or bone marrow. The main panel from that study is reproduced below.

They found that TGF-β induced surface expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (AngPTL4) on ER- breast tumor cells via the Smad signaling pathway. AngPTL4 regulates vascular endothelial permeability of lung capillaries, but not of bone marrow capillaries. 

Disseminating LMS+/ER- breast tumor cells "primed" by high levels of TGF-β were more likely to metastasize to lung and reduce overall survival time compared to LMS+/ER- breast tumor cells that were not primed with TGF-β.
LMS+/ER- cells that did not receive TGF-β stimulation metastasized preferentially to bone rather than lung.
LMS-/ER- tumor cells failed to metastasize to either location.

In this case, it is the molecular signaling history of the tumor cells which determines if and how they will disseminate.
Pre-Metastatic Niche Model
In this model, tumor cells secrete specific factors into circulation that modify sites outside of the local tissue so they are more conducive to tumor cell attachment, proliferation, or invasion.

One of the first studies to document pre-metastatic niche modification examined how breast tumor cells stimulate bone marrow derived cells to pre-modify bone marrow so that it better supports invading tumor cells. Erler (2008) found that breast tumor cells can secrete the enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX), which cross-links collagen Type IV in basement membranes of epithelium. This recruits CD11b+ bone marrow cells (BMDCs) to the sites; these cells then produce matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), which further modifies the local extracellular matrix so that breast tumor cells can invade more quickly. The study is convincing for several reasons:

The authors demonstrate that LOX accumulation occurs well before BMDCs appear.
The number of BMCCs recruited to sites correlates to the number of tumor cells that colonize successfully.
Both upregulation and shRNA knockdown (below) of LOX in two separate breast tumor lines knocks down their ability to form metastases.
The extensively controlled studies in mice were cross-checked to human tissues; breast metastases do in fact have larger numbers of CD11b+ BMDCs, and evidence of LOX modification of Collagen IV.


Current thinking is that sites of future metastasis are selectively and actively modified by the primary tumor well before metastatic spread has occurred. Tumors induce formation of pre-metastatic niches in distant organs that promote survival and outgrowth of the tumor cells before their arrival at these sites.

Niches form through a stepwise process by tumor secreted factors and extracellular vesicles. Niche formation starts with local changes such as the induction of vascular leakiness, or remodeling of stroma or extracellular matrix. Initial changes then recruit hematopoietic bone marrow cells.

Back in the primary tumor, myeloid immune cells are recruited that travel WITH tumor cells in blood, keeping them from triggering immune attack. When tumor cells arrive in the pre-metastatic niche, the hematopoietic cells continue to shield them from immune attack.

One of the tantalizing corollaries of this model is that different sub-populations of transformed cells may be "pre-programmed" to colonize different sites. In other words, some cells in a primary site tumor with Molecular Profile "A" might only be able to colonize niches in liver or bone, while other primary site cells with Molecular Profile "B" might only be able to survive in niches in liver and lungs. Both sub-sets of cells can spread to liver niches successfully, but each also has unique potential sites for dissemination.

Exosomes are another exciting piece of this story. Exosomes are small vesicles released from the surface of many different types of cells. We are just now starting to understand how exosomes contribute to normal cell communication, but we are fairly confident that exosomes are as important in stimulating formation of premetastatic niches as circulating cytokines, growth factors, and hormones are to development of the initial tumor mass.

A recent review by Peinado and Lyden (2017) describes our current state of knowledge about premetastatic niches in more depth.


Some Final Thoughts
Over the semester we have examined in depth many of the important signaling pathways and cell processes that lead normal cells to transform then grow into complex tumors. Along the way it is easy to forget that there is much we still do not know about cancer.

In 2011 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) established the Provocative Questions (PQ) Initiative. The goal of the program is to:

Identify specific hard questions, problems and paradoxes in cancer research , and
Provide funding for research projects using sound and innovative research strategies to solve them.

Some of the questions are based on older neglected observations that were never explored fully. Other PQs are based on gaps in our knowledge. Still other PQs are inspired by contradictory evidence.  A few PQs are questions that cancer researchers have had for a long time, but seemed un-answerable without recent technical or computing advances.

The Provocative Questions Initiative is only a small part of NCI's research budget, but the areas  they identify and fund provide us with insights into what leading cancer researchers think are the "wicked hard" questions in the field.

These are 11 of the 12 questions identified in 2017 (the most recent cycle), to be funded by this program over the the next 2-3 years. I divided them into specific research tools or techniques, basic research questions, and clinical research and patient outcomes questions.

Other groups have identified additional "open questions" related to cancer treatment. These are three that I think are particularly important.

What is the role of physical activity and lifestyle in cancer progression?
We know that diet affects our odds of developing cancer, and how cancer will progress. We know much less about how physical activity affects it.

Why and how do tumors maintain and break dormancy?
Most cancer treatments begin with the assumption that the tumor cells are actively growing. We now know that tumor cells may lay dormant for decades, and that many never emerge from dormancy. What keeps them dormant? Is there signaling passing between the primary and dormant disseminated tumors?

Should we treat cancer as a chronic condition to manage, not a disease to cure?
Our strategies for treating cancer are based on the assumptions that all tumors are dangerous and that elimination is the best option. Regulations and requirements governing cancer clinical trials make it nearly impossible NOT to start with this assumption. Yet we know this is not always true:
Current evidence from prostate cancer suggests that leaving the early stages untreated REDUCES the odds of aggressive malignancy.
From ancient Egypt until the 1980s, full mastectomy (breast and underlying muscle removal) was standard practice for breast tumors of any type or size. We know now that lumpectomy is the better treatment for many breast cancers; it has less of a negative impact on quality of life, and tumors caught in the early stage are not any more likely to metastasize after lumpectomy vs. mastectomy.
Cancer treatments themselves are a major contributor to new tumors. Prior cancer treatment is a well-established risk factor for developing cancer at a new site. Radiation and chemotherapies that use genotoxins or DNA damaging agents can eliminate current tumors, but increase mutation load in the body. How would this statistic change if we sought to manage growth rather than eliminate the tumor?

When does quality of life override survival?
The primary outcome measures used to evaluate whether a cancer treatment is or is not successful are Overall Survival and Disease Free Survival times. Conspicuously absent from the decision are measures of quality of life.

Ask a survivor who endured radiation or chemotherapy to describe how the experience changed their daily life. Many current treatments are brutal assaults on the body. Yet patient literature glosses over those facts, and stresses survival. Follow-on care guidelines can put great pressure on patients to continue treatment as well, regardless of their quality of life. One example of this problem is the growing push to keep women on tamoxifen or other hormone blockers for 10 years after breast removal (versus the prior recommendation of 5 years.)

For many patients, fewer good years is more important than many painful years. Yet treatment regimens still stress longevity only. 

Probably the two biggest open challenges in cancer biology relate to patient care. The first is obvious: we need new and better diagnostic tools and treatments that can find and control cancers that are intractable currently. Therapies have improved greatly, but first-choice treatments for many cancers still are the same toxic compounds that have been used since the 1970s.

The other challenge relates to treatment and care disparities. Look at the middle and right panel photos below. If all three of these people have cancer, who is most likely to survive?

Out of the three, the young boy is MOST likely to survive. Sadly the black adult man is LEAST likely to survive. Averaging difference in survival rates between ethnic groups (and accounting for gender,) his chances for 5-year survival are 15-22% lower than the nurse who is caring for him, even if they have the same cancer. A great deal remains to be done to overcome systemic health care disparities, not just based on ethnicity, but also for people of different socio-economic and educational levels.

Introduction
Many people worry that substances or exposures in their environment may cause cancer. As part of the American Cancer Society's role in educating people about cancer and its possible causes, this document lists substances and exposures known or suspected to cause cancer. The lists come from two highly respected agencies – the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US National Toxicology Program (NTP).

Cancer is caused by changes in a cell’s DNA. Some of these changes may be inherited from our parents, while others may be caused by outside exposures, which are often referred to as environmental factors. Environmental factors can include a wide range of exposures, such as:

Lifestyle factors (nutrition, tobacco use, physical activity, etc.)
Naturally occurring exposures (ultraviolet light, radon gas, infectious agents, etc.)
Medical treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, immune system-suppressing drugs, etc.)
Workplace exposures
Household exposures
Pollution

Substances and exposures that can lead to cancer are called carcinogens. Some carcinogens do not affect DNA directly, but cause cells to divide at a faster than normal rate, which could increase the chances that DNA changes will occur.

Carcinogens do not automatically cause cancer. They have different levels of cancer-causing potential. Some cause cancer only after prolonged, high levels of exposure. And for any particular person, the risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including how they are exposed to a carcinogen, the length and intensity of the exposure, and the person's genetic makeup.
How Do Researchers identify Carcinogens?
Testing to see if something can cause cancer is often difficult. It is not ethical to test a substance by exposing people to it and seeing if they get cancer. That’s why scientists must use other types of tests, which may not always give clear answers.

Lab studies
Scientists get much of the data about whether something might be a carcinogen from lab studies in cell cultures, then if needed, in animals. There are far too many substances (both natural and man-made) to test each one individually, so scientists use what is already known about chemical structures, results from other types of lab tests, studies on human exposure, and other factors to select chemicals for testing. For example, they can often predict whether a substance might damage DNA by comparing it to similar chemicals that have already been studied.

Lab studies alone can't always predict if a substance will increase the risk of cancer in people. Almost all human carcinogens also promote cancer in lab animals, but the reverse is not always true. Some substances that are carcinogens in lab animals do not have the same effect in people. There are several reasons why. First, most studies of potential carcinogens expose the lab animals to doses that are much higher than common human exposures. This is so that cancer risk can be detected in relatively small groups of animals. However is not always clear if the results from animal studies with a high dose will be the same for people who usually are exposed to a lower dose of a substance. Second, the way we are exposed matters. The effects of a substance when it is inhaled may not be the same as if it is applied to the skin. Third, the bodies of lab animals and humans don't always process substances in the same way. Fourth, lab animals get different kinds of cancer than humans; what increases their types of cancer might not always increase our types of cancer.

Even with all these differences though, for safety reasons it is usually assumed that exposures that cause cancer at larger doses in animals may also cause cancer in people. It isn't always possible to know how the exposure dose might affect risk, but it is reasonable for public health purposes to assume that lowering human exposure will reduce risk.

Studies in people and populations
Another important way to identify carcinogens is through epidemiologic studies, which look at human populations to determine which factors might be linked to cancer. These studies also provide useful information, but they have their limits. Humans do not live in a controlled environment. People are exposed to many substances at any given time, including those they encounter at work, school, or home; in the food they eat; and in the air they breathe. It's very unlikely they know exactly what they've been exposed to or that they would be able to remember all of their exposures if asked by a researcher. And there are usually many years (often decades) between exposure to a carcinogen and the development of cancer. Therefore, it can be very hard to definitely link any particular exposure to cancer.

By combining data from both types of studies, scientists do their best to make an educated assessment of a substance's cancer-causing ability. When the evidence is conclusive, the substance is labeled as a carcinogen. When the available evidence is compelling but not felt to be conclusive, the substance may be considered to be a probable carcinogen. But in some cases there simply isn't enough information to be certain one way or the other.
Who Determines How Carcinogens Are Classified?
Several agencies (national and international) are responsible for determining the cancer-causing potential of different substances. We will look at two of them.

International Agency for Research on Cancer
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). Its major goal is to identify the  of cancer. The most widely used system for classifying carcinogens comes from the IARC. In the past 30 years, the IARC has evaluated the cancer-causing potential of more than 900 likely candidates, placing them into one of the following groups:

Group 1: Known to be carcinogenic to humans
Group 2A: Probably is carcinogenic to humans
Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans
Group 3: Unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans
Group 4: Probably not carcinogenic to humans

Perhaps not surprisingly, based on how hard it can be to test these candidate carcinogens, most are listed as being of probable, possible, or unknown risk. Only a little over 100 are classified as “known carcinogenic to humans.”

National Toxicology Program
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP updates its Report on Carcinogens (RoC) every few years.

The Report on Carcinogens has just 2 groups of agents:

Known to be human carcinogens
Reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens

The current version of the RoC lists about 240 substances and exposures. Unlike the IARC's list, the RoC does not list substances that have been studied and found not to be carcinogens.

Environmental Protection Agency
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an electronic database that contains information on human health effects from exposure to certain substances in the environment. The EPA uses a rating system similar to that of IARC when describing the cancer-causing potential of a substance:

Group A: Carcinogenic to humans
Group B: Likely to be carcinogenic to humans
Group C: Suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential
Group D: Inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential
Group E: Not likely to be carcinogenic to humans

Other agencies and groups
Other federal agencies, such as the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute may comment on whether a substance or exposure may cause cancer and/or what levels of exposure to a particular substance might be considered acceptable.

Some state agencies also keep lists of known or probable carcinogens. For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) maintains a list of "chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity." (Much of this list is based on the IARC and NTP lists below.)
The American Cancer Society's Role
The American Cancer Society (ACS) contributes in many ways to evaluating how environmental factors affect a person's likelihood of developing cancer, including:

Conducting epidemiologic research on the causes of cancer
Funding laboratory and epidemiologic research at universities and other institutions that study environmental causes of cancer
Advocating for environmental health on a local, state, and federal level
Informing the public about environmental factors that affect cancer risk and how to decrease their risk of developing cancer

In most cases, the ACS does not directly evaluate whether a certain substance or exposure causes cancer. Instead, the ACS looks to national and international organizations such as the NTP and IARC, whose mission is to evaluate environmental cancer risks based on evidence from laboratory and human research studies.
More About IARC and NTP
The IARC and NTP act independently but have studied many of the same agents, so many known or suspected carcinogens appear on both lists. But because an agent appears on one and not on the other does not necessarily mean there is a controversy, as one agency may not have evaluated it.

Unfortunately, many of the substances and exposures on the lists below can often go by different names. This can make it hard to find a particular substance on one or both of these lists, which are in alphabetical order and may not always use the most common term.

These lists include only those agents that have been evaluated by the agencies. These agencies tend to focus on substances and exposures most likely to cause cancer, but there are many others that have not been studied fully yet.

Most of the agents on the lists have been linked only with certain kinds of cancer, not all types. For more detailed information, refer to the specific monographs or reports published by the agencies (available on their Web sites).

The lists themselves say nothing about how likely it is that an agent will cause cancer. Carcinogens do not cause cancer at all times, under all circumstances. Some may only be carcinogenic if a person is exposed in a certain way (for example, swallowing it as opposed to touching it). Some may only cause cancer in people who have a certain genetic makeup. Some of these agents may lead to cancer after only a very small exposure, while others might require intense exposure over many years. Again, you should refer to the agencies' reports for specifics.

Even if a substance or exposure is known or suspected to cause cancer, this does not necessarily mean that it can or should be avoided at all costs. For example, exposure to ionizing radiation is known to cause cancer, with increased risks even at low levels of exposure. Yet there is no way to completely prevent exposure to natural sources of radiation such as cosmic radiation from the sun or radon in soil. These lists also include many commonly used medicines, particularly some hormones and drugs used to treat cancer. For example, tamoxifen increases the risk of certain kinds of uterine cancer but can be very useful in treating some breast cancers, which may be more important for some women. If you have questions about a medicine that appears on one of these lists, be sure to ask your doctor.

Looking at the list below can tell you whether or not something may increase your risk of cancer, but it is important to try to get an idea of how much it might increase your risk. It is also important to know what your risk is to begin with. Many factors can enter into this, including your age, gender, family history, and lifestyle factors (tobacco and alcohol use, weight, diet, physical activity level, etc.). As noted above, the type and extent of exposure to a substance may also play a role. You should consider the actual amount of increased risk when deciding if you should limit or avoid an exposure.

2. Basic Signaling
Thousands of scientists spend their professional lives working out the details of cell signaling. A course on cell signaling would have to meet daily for an entire semester just to review of the major families of signaling pathways we have discovered. It is VERY easy to get lost in the details of signaling. Fortunately, signaling pathways are surprisingly easy to understand on a basic level. The key is to step back and remember WHY cells use signaling.

Key Concept 1: Like whole organisms, cells must perform certain activities to survive.
They must:

Sense and respond to their internal and external environments.
Maintain internal homeostasis. This includes ionic balance, energy balance, and water balance.
Contribute appropriately to the proper function of the tissue in which they are located. 

A cell uses one or more general processes to do this. It's available options are:

Alter growth rate
Differentiate, OR wait to differentiate
Divide faster, halt it temporarily, or withdraw from the cell cycle permanently
Change which metabolic pathways are most active
Change its homeostatic set-points
Reorganize its cytoskeleton, change shape, or move
Change its connections to neighboring cells or the extracellular matrix
Send chemical or electrical signals to other cells
Destroy itself by anoikis or apoptosis 


Key Concept 2: A cell's developmental history determines which general processes it can use.
As cells differentiate during development, many genes and systems shut off permanently. How they respond to a stimulus will depend on which general processes are still active, and how the cells have specialized.

Example: keratinocytes and melanocytes are found in the same physical location in the epidermis of human skin. However, they respond VERY differently to the same stimulus.



Left: schematic showing the epidermis and dermis of skin. The outer epidermal layer of skin is made of multiple layers of keratinocytes. Only keratinocytes in the basal layer of epidermis undergo mitosis (red layer in close-up illustration.) As they proliferate they push older keratinocytes upward to the surface where they are shed as dead skin. Melanocytes are stellate cells that reside in the basal layer near the proliferating keratinocytes. Right: cross section through a benign melanin-enriched tumor. The dark, near-black cells in the deepest part of the epidermis are melanocytes. All other cells in the epidermis are keratinocytes. In this particular type of benign tumor, excess melanin is deposited into the dense cell aggregates that seem to be suspended in the middle of the layers of epidermis.

If skin is exposed to UV radiation:

Keratinocytes respond to the UV stimulus by proliferation, then migration outwards, which thickens the outer layers of skin.Their cytoskeleton changes too.
Melanocytes respond to UV by activating metabolism and secretion. They synthesize additional melanin pigment, package it into granules, and export the granules to keratinocytes. This darkens the skin and protects underlying structures.  

Both keratinocyts and melanocytes have the same genome. They respond differently because they have followed different developmental paths.

Keratinocytes came from the ectodermal (outer) layer of the embryo, and have differentiated into epithelial cells. They are specialized to form sheet-like barrier layers.
Melanocytes derive from the neural crest, near the midline of an embryo. They migrated into skin, then differentiated into cells specialized for secretion.

The 2 cell types have different surface and internal receptors acting as the cells' environmental sensors. Some of their internal signal transduction pathways are the same, while others are not. The pathways turn on different genes and other responses that are specific to each cell type.

Key Concept 3: Cells use signaling NETWORKS to regulate normal functions.
In the early days of cell signaling research, the goal was to identify and organize signaling molecules into clear pathways: Protein A sent a signal to Protein B, which sent the signal to Protein C, and so on. The first complete growth signaling pathway was finally worked out in 1983, for epidermal growth factor (EGF). When it was published we could say confidently that EGF receptor sent a signal to Grb2, which transferred the signal to Sos, and so on, until we reached 3 transcription factors that would activate cell growth.

This was the original map of EGF signaling (ignore the PI3-K path and the STAT path; when the EGFR path was published, we did not even know these other pathways existed):
Almost immediately researchers began to find the proteins in the EGF signaling pathway were also sending signals into other pathways. Every new pathway that was worked out seemed to be sending signals through the main path, but also signaling to other pathways. Over time it became clear that cells signaling pathways do not act in isolation. Instead, each pathway is part of an internal network of signals. For example, this is the current map of signals moving in and out of the main EGFR pathway, and known connections to OTHER signaling networks. Cells respond to the overall activity level of the entire NETWORK, not just one path.


Even this map is over-simplified though. It only shows positive and negative interactions. It does not show the signal strength in each path.

Key Concept 4: Most people do not realize how BIG a field signaling includes, and how many times they have studied it. 
For example, when we learn how animals use hormones to control their bodies, we are talking about signaling. Hormones are ligands that bind to hormone receptors. That triggers a signal transduction pathway that leads to changes in the target cells and organs.

Likewise, when nerves send neurotransmitters to another neuron or an end-target organ, they are signaling. Neurotransmitters are the ligands that bind to receptors on the target dendrites or tissue. Gated ion channels open, and ion flux creates a change in electrical potential across the membrane. That electrical potential is a signal.

Key Concept 5: Cells use macromolecules, small molecules and even ions and gases for transmitting signals.
The receptors and downstream biochemical machinery that a cell uses to bind and respond to signals are proteins mostly. However, signaling molecules themselves are extremely diverse, coming from every major class of macromolecules. There also are small molecules, ions, and even gases that are used for signaling.

3. Cell-Cell Connections

Cell-cell connections allow cells to communicate with other cells and the extracellular membrane (ECM). Without cell-cell connections, cells would not be able to form structured and properly functioning tissues. Furthermore, regulation of cell-cell connections is essential to wound response and cell migration. Since cancer cells harness wound response and cell migration pathways to permit extensive angiogenesis, metastasis, and invasion, it is important to understand the basics of cell-cell connections. 

Types of Molecules present in Cell-Cell Connections:



Integrins

Integrins are transmembrane proteins that anchor the cell to the ECM or to other cells. Between cells, integrins aggregate to form adherens junctions, linking the cytoskeletons together. This means that changes in one cell’s cytoskeleton (represented in the figure below as actin) will signal changes to other cells through integrin connections. This same mechanism allows the cell cytoskeleton to signal changes to the ECM through integrins and vice versa. Integrins are overexpressed in some ovarian and colorectal cancers (Brücher and Jamall 2014), indicating that they are one type of cell connection molecule that is disrupted during tumor development.



The Cytoskeleton:

Every cell’s three-dimensional structure and motility is modulated by activity of the cell cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton provides strength and structure while also allowing the cell to be flexible and motile when needed. Furthermore, the cytoskeleton components are used in different types of cell junctions to link cells together.

The cytoskeleton is composed of a few different kinds of polymers, each with their own unique function in promoting strength and motility. We will discuss the two that are involved in the cell-cell connections detailed below: intermediate filaments and actin.

Intermediate Filaments

Intermediate Filaments provide mechanical strength to the cytoskeleton and are less dynamic than actin filaments. They attach to cadherins to form desmosomes. The three-dimensional structure of intermediate filaments is shown in the figure below. While the details are not important, it is important to note that intermediate filaments are comprised of several strands coiled around each other. This structure is what gives intermediate filaments their strength.


Actin Filaments

Actin filaments are composed of actin monomers and can be rapidly assembled and disassembled. This property of actin gives the cytoskeleton flexibility and allows cell motility. When a cell begins to move, actin polymerizes near the leading edge, pushing the cell forwards.



Actin filaments are also linked to the ECM through integrins and cadherins junctions. This means that signals from the ECM can eventually cause changes in cell motility by signaling to the actin filaments through integrin. (See the first figure above for a visual of actin’s connection to the ECM).


Cadherins

Cadherins got their name because they are "calcium-dependent adhesion" molecules. They are a type of transmembrane protein and form adherens junctions to bind cells in tissues together. Cadherins are made up a small cytoplasmic component, a transmembrane portion, and the remaining majority of the protein is extracellular. 

In humans, there are over 100 different types of cadherins. The E-cadherin-catenin complex is involved in cellular adhesion. Loss of this function has been associated with tumor metastasis (H6. Angiogenesis & Metastasis). Beta-catenin is a binding partner for cadherin proteins. B-catenin is involved in Wnt signaling, which modulates transcription (H2C: APC Protein). 


Types of Cell-Cell Connections:



Tight Junctions

Tight junctions seal adjacent epithelial cells just beneath their apical surface, forming an effectively impermeable barrier to fluid. Tight junctions are composed of a network of proteins, mostly claudins and occludins, and work by joining together the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. The most obvious function of tight junctions is that they hold cells together. Additionally, tight junctions are responsible for two vital functions in a cell: first, they limit the passage of molecules and ions through the space between cells. Therefore, most materials must enter the cell through diffusion or active transport in order to bypass the tissue. This allows for tighter control over what molecules can pass through the cell. Second, tight junctions prevent the movement of integral membrane proteins between the apical and basolateral surfaces of the cell. The apical and basolateral surfaces of the cell each have proteins that are specific to that portion of the membrane. Tight junctions block the movement of these proteins to the wrong surface, and as a result they preserve the special function of each surface.

Adherens Junctions

Adherens junctions provide strong mechanical attachments between adjacent cells. They serve as a bridge connecting the actin cytoskeleton of neighboring cells through direct interaction. Adherens junctions are composed of cadherins and catenins. Cadherins are transmembrane proteins whose extracellular segments bind to each other and whose intracellular segments bind to catenins. Catenins are connected to actin filaments. In most cases, a cell expressing one particular type of cadherin (of which there are 80 unique types) will only form adherens junctions with another cell expressing the same type of cadherin. The reason for this is because cadherins tend to form homodimers rather than heterodimers. Mutations in a gene that encodes cadherin may result in stomach cancer. In addition, adherens junctions that do not function properly can cause tumor metastasis.

Desmosomes

Desmosomes are localized patches that hold two cells tightly together. Desmosomes are attached to intermediate filaments of keratin in the cytoplasm and are commonly found in epithelia. The cell adhesion proteins of the desmosome belong to the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules. They are transmembrane proteins that bridge the space between adjacent epithelial cells through homophobic binding of their extracellular domains to other desmosomal cadherins on the adjacent cell. 

C:\Users\altaei13\Pictures\Desmosome.png

Hemidesmosomes
Hemidesmosomes are multi-protein complexes that form attachment sites between the basal surface of epithelial cells and the underlying basement membrane. They are similar to desmosomes, but attach to the basement membrane rather than each other. The outside is composed of integrins that bind to collagen and laminin and keratin filaments protrude into the cytoplasm. 




Gap Junctions
Gap Junctions are the most widespread of all cell junctions in animal tissues. These junctions form a narrow gap, roughly 2-4 nm, between two adjacent cells. This couples cells electrically and metabolically. The junctions may open or close in response to changes in calcium levels, pH, or voltage. A group of proteins called connexins form a 6-member complex called a connexon (seen in the figure below). When the connexons of two adjacent cells align, they form a continuous channel between them. The channel is big enough for small inorganic molecules and other water soluble molecules to pass between them, but too small for proteins, nucleic acids, and sugars. Some evidence has been shown that loss of gap junction intercellular communication is an important step in carcinogenesis. Cancer cells also typically have downregulated levels of gap junctions. Cells with poor communication to neighboring cells grow more and are more likely to go rogue and initiate cancer cell metastasis. 


4. Structure of ECM
Extracellular Matrix Structure 

The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a variety of resources essential to a cell's survival. As multi-cellular organisms evolved, structures such as the extracellular matrix allowed for complexity, stability, and regulation. From cell-to-cell communication to basic mitosis and proliferation, the ECM allows for basic functioning of cellular structures that provide key supportive functions throughout the lifetime of an organism and its cellular makeup. Figure 1 depicts where the extracellular matrix begins and ends in relationship to the cell. 

Figure 1. The extracellular matrix and its extensive connectivity with the cell 

Key Concept 1: Makeup and Key Components 

The goal of the section is to outline the main components of the ECM. There are three main types of proteins found in the ECM: linkage proteins, such as fibronectins and laminins, proteoglycans, and fibrous proteins. The most prevalent fibrous proteins for our discussion will be collagens and elastin.

Linkage Proteins

Fibronectins- This linkage or bridging protein of the ECM binds to integrins in addition to the other ECM components. Integrins are receptor proteins which span the membrane of the cell. Fibronectins exist as dimers. The monomers, of nearly identical structure, are joined by disulfide bonds. Figure 2 depicts how fibronectin interacts with integrins and other ECM proteins. The binding sites of a fibronectin protein are extensive. Along with their role in adhesion, migration, and differentiation, fibronectins are intimately involved in the wound healing process. Fibronectin proteins form a blood clot at the site of injury and protect the underlying tissue. The domains that constitute both types of linkage proteins mentioned here bind to both proteoglycans and collagen/elastin, or fibrous proteins. They, as their name suggests, are what holds the complexity of molecules that comprise the ECM together. Cells are then able to detect the presence of the ECM based on the composition of molecules present in the area, as they are able to bind laminin and fibronectin to detect their location. 

Figure 2. Fibronectin dimers interact with integrins attached to the membrane

Laminins-Laminins are the main component of the basal lamina, which is a layer of the basement membrane and provides the foundation for most cells. In terms of structure, these proteins are heterotrimeric with an alpha, beta, and gamma subunit as seen in Figure 3 below. The chains combine to form various structures, many of which are sheet like. Like the other linkage/bridging proteins, laminins are important for cell migration, differentiation, and adhesion. The structural scaffolding of nearly every tissue relies on laminin. 



Figure 3. Heterotrimeric laminin protein: alpha, beta, gamma subunits

Proteoglycans

Proteoglycans are largely composed of glycosaminoglycan chains with a core protein. The hydrophilic nature of these proteins allow them to adopt unique conformations. In essence, the interactions of these proteins forms a sort of hydrogel, capable of withstanding compressive forces. Figure 4 underscores that the hydrated gel fills the majority of the extracellular space within the tissue. Interestingly, mutations in genes related to proteoglycans has been linked to several genetic diseases. Not surprisingly, proteoglycans have an abundantly varied set of functions including buffering, hydration, binding, and force resistance. 

Figure 4. Extensive networks of proteoglycans fill the ECM 

Fibrous Proteins

Collagens-These are the most abundant of the fibrous proteins in the interstitial ECM and can account for up to 30% of the total protein mass in an organism. Figure 5 illustrates the main structural feature of collagens: a triple stranded helical molecule. Collagen molecules pack together to form long thin fibrils. Consequently, collagens tend to provide tensile strength, regulate cell adhesion, support chemotaxis and migration, and direct tissue development. The specific organization of collagen fibers can dramatically alter the structure of the ECM. Although many different types of collagen have been identified, a few types predominate over the others. 

Figure 5. Visualization of the collagen fiber at the level of the triple helices 

Elastin-The next fibrous protein to address is elastin because of its frequent interaction with collagen. Elastin proteins are usually rich in hydrophobic amino acids like glycine and proline although it does have a soluble component (tropoelastin). The conformational disorder of these proteins is consistent with their function. Figure 6 below shows how the conformational change is consistent with function. Elastin serves to allow tissues a recoil after stretching or contracting. The mechanism of elastic recoil is entropy driven. Elastin stretch is limited by the collagen fibers they are in contact with. 


Figure 6. Elastin structure during stretch and relaxation 




Key Concept 2: Important Functions in Cell 

In terms of maintaining homeostasis, the ECM regulates and segregates tissues in terms of their spatial orientation as well as their communication between one another. The ECM also serves an important role in growth, as it is able to regulate and hold large quantities and varieties of growth factor ligands, thus determining in part, the fate of the cell's growth and life. Components of the ECM are also know contributors to wound healing, cell migration, gene expression, and differentiation. Specifically, the stiffness and elasticity of the ECM plays an important role in cell migration, gene expression and differentiation. Cells actively sense ECM rigidity and migrate preferentially towards stiffer surfaces, which is known as durotaxis. Additionally, they also sense elasticity and adjust their gene expression, which impacts differentiation and cancer progression. ECM components interact with cell-surface receptors to initiate signal transduction and regulate gene transcription. 

Many ECM proteins have binding sites for both cell adhesion and growth factors, which allows local concentration of the growth factors to their cell surface receptors and cell adhesion sites. The localization of growth factors, and thus their signaling, allows the establishment of gradients of the soluble, growth factors, which ultimately play a key role in developmental processes. Examples include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), which both bind to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and can be cleaved from glycosaminoglycan components of HSPG by the enzyme heparanase and released as soluble ligands. It is important to note that ECM-bound growth factors do not have to be released in soluble form to function. As a matter of fact, FGFs bind to their receptors with heparin sulfate (HS) as a cofactor, while HSPG "presents" these ligands during signaling.

Additionally, ECM glycoproteins play a key role in development of the nervous system. They regulate diverse processes such as neural stem cell behavior, neuronal migration, formation of axonal processes and their myelin sheets, and synapse formation and function. Fibronectin is important for cell migration during development, and has shown implications in cardiovascular disease and tumor metastasis. Overall, cells use this outer communicative means to determine areas for favorable migration, good growing conditions, and an overall sense of the world around them. There have been studies suggesting that the ECM is a target for metastatic cancers as they aim to break down the ECM in order to invade surrounding tissues.

Below is a short video describing some of the functions the extracellular matrix plays in maintaining the cell's homeostasis, growth regulations, gene expression, and more. 

YouTube Video


Key Concept 3: Alterations Present in Cancer 

The extracellular matrix is an important component of the microenvironment in which a cancer cell resides. While normally the ECM acts to maintain a controlled homeostasis, the ECM becomes deregulated and disorganized during cancer development. During cancer progression, the ECM promotes cellular transformation and metastasis. The ECM also deregulates stromal cells and enables angiogenesis and inflammation. The architecture of the ECM is also different in cancerous tissue. Different collagens show increased deposition during tumor formation as compared to collagens of normal tissue, and linearized collagen fibrils form instead of the normal, non-oriented fibrils. ECM stiffness also seems to increase in a number of cancers. These structural changes in the ECM up-regulate integrin signaling, which promotes cell survival and proliferation.

Below is a video summarizing the transformation of tumor cells as they begin to metastasize and migrate to other regions of the body. While they are more topics discussed in this video, it shows some key steps in migration which involve the breakdown of the extracellular matrix in order to move about. Tissue invasion and migration are dependent upon the tumor's ability to disrupt and breakdown the extracellular matrix surrounding the cell and tissues. 
YouTube Video

ECM remodeling:
Remodeling of the extracellular matrix is carried out by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's) during embryogenesis, wound healing, proliferation, replication, and angiogenesis, and also plays an important role in tumor metastasis . MMP's degrade various components of the ECM, and endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP's) reduce excessive ECM degradation by MMP's. MMP's are excreted by fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. They are originally expressed as zymogens (inactive enzymes) and are activated by other MMP's or other proteolytic enzymes. Different MMP's break down different components of the ECM, but in general, MMP's break down laminin, collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and other ECM proteins.

5. Tissue Wound Responses

Key Concept #1: Blood clots and fibrin molecule

When cut or injured there are a cascade of events that take place in order to heal the wound as efficiently as possible. However, we only want blood clots in certain situations, because severe blood clots in the body can results in death. Blood clots form when fibrinogen is cleaved and activated to form fibrin. Fibrinogen is cleaved so that several fibrin molecules gain the ability to stick to one another and form a clot, as well as an amino acid complex. This is a cascade of events because you want amplification for immediate results.



Key Concept #2: Wound Signaling and Healing Structure 

Your body goes through a specific process to heal a wound. You have three main layers of your skin: the epidermis, dermis, and fat. First, you start bleeding and a clot will eventually form and will stop the bleeding. This clot seals off the wound as a complex tissue and is commonly known as a scar. In addition, when blood touches oxygen granules are released, which will cause degranulation of the platelets. Degranulation releases PDGF (platelet derived growth factor), and this triggers a series of tissue responses.


Below, figure 2 (on the left) shows all of the key components of the would healing process and how they interact with each other in this complex process. On the right, figure three shows the three large phases of the would healing process and how they progress over time.




Source: http://www.clinimed.co.uk/portals/10/images/Wound%20Healing%20Graph%202.jpg

Inflammatory Response

The healing process begins the very moment someone is injured. The wound starts to fill up with blood, and the collagen is exposed to blood which causes platelet degranulation to begin. This is when clot formation and the amplification systems begin.

Blood Clotting

During the clotting process degranulation of platelets occurs and releases PDGF. Platelets secrete effector molecules during injury and contain granules that store proteins. Therefore, when platelets are activated, they release these stored proteins. The alpha granule in particular contains polypeptides of fibrinogen.

PMNs and Macrophages

As the clot starts to form around the edges of the wound, this site starts to become infested with mitogens and chemo attractants.  Soon the wound becomes inflamed, which causes pain and swelling. We must remember that several molecules have the ability to enter from the wound site from when it was first exposed, and this is where immune cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) enter the injured site. PMN is responsible for phagocytosis of bacteria, so the healing process can occur without this step only if bacteria has not entered the wound site. PMN does not usually stay around for a long time, and typically leaves the wound site no later than the third day. Macrophages are far more effective than PMN because macrophages stay in the wound site throughout the entire healing process. Macrophages perform a similar role to PMNs because they digest tissue debris. PDGF is able to recruit macrophages in the early immune and inflammatory cells, and these cells are about to digest matrix and allow it to be reconstructed.



Proliferative phase

During this part of healing, granulation tissue, including fibroblasts and inflammatory cells, begins to form. Fibroblasts appear in big numbers and are derived from mesenchymal cells. In addition, fibroblasts produce an abundance of collagen, which will serve as the wound matrix. PDGF is a major signaling molecule during the healing process, and is necessary in order for fibroblasts to divide. PDGF is prevalent in wound healing, and regulates cell growth and division. Collagen is then responsible for the strength and stiffness of the wound that will eventually form a scar towards the end of the healing process. Furthermore, revascularization of wounds in response to angiogenic stimuli occurs in this phase. PDGF plays a huge role in angiogenesis, which is the blood vessel formation from existing blood vessels. During this angiogenesis step, capillary loops form for blood to flow through. However, while collagen and fibroblasts serve as the wound matrix, and while revascularization of blood flow occurs deep within the wound, re-epithelialization occurs on the surface of the wound. During re-epithelialization, TGF-Beta triggers epithelial mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in the epidermal epithelium layer of the skin. This serves to close up the injury, or wound site, and fill the skin back in. 


Maturation phase and Scarring

Maturation and scarring are the final steps that lead to complete wound healing. During maturation, reorganization begins to take place. PDGF has the ability to go to fibroblasts in order to initiate changes in their phenotype, move into the wound, attach to the matrix, and pull the would shut using myofibroblasts. These myofibroblasts are what make the TGF-Beta, another important signaling molecule during wound healing. Once the myofibroblasts are activated, the TGF-Beta keep themselves activated as well. This process does not shut off until you shut off or block this internal cycle through the autocrine loop, which is when the cell secretes a signal and that signal binds to the receptors of that same cell. Therefore, in order to stop making TGF-Beta, you must kill the myofibroblasts or degrade the excess TGF-Beta. Moreover, as the matrix is repaired, it will start soaking up extra TGF-Beta. This slowly moves into the scarring process which is when the myofibroblasts create a stiff and hard tissue by condensing. In order to create this healing tissue, collagen fibers become cross-linked with one another in order to increase the stiffness. In addition, full contraction begins to occur as the wound site fully closes, and this happens through cell surface receptors in contraction. In order to gain full tensile strength of the wound sight during scarring take a tremendous amount of time.

Below, figure 4 shows the progression from a blood clot to a scar during the remodeling process.

Key Concept #3: How do tumors resemble wound sites?

Pulse Wave

The idea of a “Pulse Wave” is that you can get a trigger of events that activate one event after another. When we look at tumor cells, we see the EMT process, and these mesenchymal cells undergo a transition to form products that are not normally formed from epidermal cells, such as PDGF and TGF-Beta. These are signaled from epidermal cells when you are wounded, but receive an abnormal response from surrounding tissues. Most tumors and cellular masses form when there is abnormal signaling to molecules that aren’t necessary for wound healing, such as EGF, MMP, VEGF, etc…

MMP

Tumors start with epithelial cells, but the tumor will grow when EGF (epidermal growth factor) is present. This will act as an autocrine loop where the tumor feeds itself with growth factor, and EGF is not part of the normal wound healing process. More molecules begin to become activated that normally aren’t part of this healing process. MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) are molecules that degrade the matrix, and as they do this they also release PDGF and TGF-Beta, which switch to fibroblasts from myofibroblasts. The matrix is a mesh work of binding sites for many growth factors and signaling molecules. Myofibroblasts are used to pull wounds together, however when myofibroblasts are activated, they activate high levels of VEGF in the vascular epithelium. Furthermore, the extracellular matrix is made up of long fibers of collagen, and a few fibers of polysaccharides that are attached to the ECM are FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and chemokines. As MMP digests and degrades the matrix, all the molecules and growth factors within the matrix become activated, which were inactive before as they were held in the ECM.

Myofibroblasts and Fibroblasts

PDGF and TGF-Beta stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts in the myofibroblasts, and when they become myofibroblasts they form denser ECM. ECM contains chemical properties that make them pull and contract tighter and tighter together. As this contraction occurs a mass begins to form that is tight and compacted. Therefore, as the tissue gets stiffer and stiffer you start to feel a lump in your skin, and this lump isn’t due to cancer cells, and is rather due to myofibroblasts that are contracting together to form stiff tissue, which is very similar to the scarring process in wound healing. While this lump formation may not seem advantageous to cancer, this lump puts a tumor in a good place to form vessel development. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is the molecule that will drive this vascular development. VEGF will be an important molecule, because without blood supply this lump will remain about half a centimeter in size and won’t have potential to grow. Once tumor cells start mixing with myofibroblasts, denser ECM is created which will lead to stimulation for the formation of blood vessels, and this makes myofibroblasts one of the primary signaling molecules for blood supply.

Macrophages

As the tissue becomes highly unorganized, tissue damage develops and this will attract macrophages to the damaged tissue sight. Within the ECM, chemokines and MCP-1 cause macrophages to come to the damaged tissue as well. In addition, after MMPs degrade and digest the matrix there are several particles left over as debris from this degradation process, and these leftover molecules will also attract macrophages. As macrophages appear to the damaged tissue site they release even more matrix proteases in order to digest the leftover debris. Moreover, TAMs (tumor associated macrophages) also play an important role in this process. TAMs produce molecules that will kill bacteria and produce MMPs that will continue to degrade tissue. However, this is process is done in a limited amount of time because there is a limited amount of PDGF, and PDGF is needed in order for this continuous growth to continue. Furthermore, as macrophages enter the tissue damaged site the also produce VEGF, which is the primary trigger for angiogenesis. Tumors normally produce this because of their environmental conditions and because they need blood supply in order to survive and grow.

Angiogenesis 

Vessels within the tumor are extremely unorganized and are prone to leakage. Capillaries in normal tissue are organized and surrounded by pericytes. The formation of blood vessels and capillaries is a precise process, however due to scrambled signaling pathways a tumor contains highly unorganized vessels and capillaries.  Angiogenesis of blood vessels has the ability to relieve hypoxia, or the state of diminished oxygen in an environment. The lack of oxygen also activates transcription factor HIF. Initiation of angiogenesis, thus, begins when the tumor needs blood supply in order to relieve its hypoxic state. HIF will become acitvated, which will then activate VEGF to form new blood vessels.


Draft. Acquired Immunity


Acquired immunity (also known as adaptive immunity or specific immunity) refers to the defenses that target specific pathogens. Compared to innate immunity (Figure 1), acquired immunity can be slower to act, but it can maintain immunological memory of an infection for a quicker, more targeted response in the event of a later infection. 



Figure 1. Roles of the innate and adaptive defenses in the human body

The acquired immune system can be divided into humoral and cell-mediated (cytotoxic) immunity, each of which has its own response to a pathogen. B-cells make up humoral immunity and T-cells make up cell-mediated immunity. B-cells and T-cells are classes of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell found in the vertebrate immune system.

B-cells and Antibodies

B-cells are named after the bursa of Fabricius, the lymphoid organ in birds in which these cells were first studied. In humans, B-cells arise from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow. B-cells leave the bone marrow to become activated in the spleen. When B-cells leave the bone marrow, they are considered mature but naїve, as they have not yet been exposed to an antigen. B-cells can also be activated in the lymph nodes, which are important organs of the immune system that filter lymph. 

Since antibodies can dissolve and act in blood, they are part of the division of acquired immunity called humoral immunity. Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are produced by B-cells and bind to antigens. Antibodies are Y-shaped molecules that are composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains that are held together by disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions. 



Figure 2. Anatomy of an antibody.

The antigen binding site is where an antigen will bind to the antibody and is located in the variable region, at the tips of the Y (Figure 2). B-cells undergo hypermutation of the antigen-binding site in order to find the right conformation for the antigen and only binds one specific antigen. Each B-cell only makes one type of antibody (IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE and IgA).The bottom portion of the Y is the constant region, where other white blood cells can bind. 

Plasma cells are fully differentiated B-cells that produce antibodies. Memory B-cells stay in the lymph node and wait for re-exposure to the same antigen. These memory cells are what make vaccinations so effective. However, in order to differentiate into these Plasma and Memory cells, the naive B-cells must be activated in the spleen. In most cases, this process requires the help of T-cells. The first step in this form of activation, known as T-cell dependent antigen activation, occurs when an antigen binds to two antibodies on the surface of the B cell. This signals to the B-cell to phagocytose the antigen, process it, and present it on its cell surface. A T-cell (discussed in more detail below) will then bind to the processed antigen and start presenting a ligand called CD40L. CD40L on the T-cell binds to a protein called CD40 on the B-cell which results in its activation. Additional roles for T-cells besides activating B-cells are outlined below. 

B-cells respond to tumor-specific antigens by generating anti-tumor antibodies that can foster tumor-cell recognition and lysis. The immune system responds when there are elevated levels of tumor-associated antigens and monitors (immunosurveillance) tissues for the presence of tumors and attempts to eliminate them. Some cancers thrive in the body despite the use of immunosurveillance because they are weakly antigenic. Tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are expressed by tumor cells and often reflect the differentiation programs of the tissues that they came from. Suppression of TAA expression may allow the tumor cells to escape immune surveillance. The tumors cells will produce poor costimulatory signals, so that antibody is not stimulated to act on tumor cell. Some tumor cells can even release factors that are capable of eliminating immune cells that venture too close. Cancer cells may attract and activate regulatory T cells, which can inactivate any cytotoxic T cells that have entered into tumor masses.


T Cells and the MHC

T Cells are at the center of acquired immunity and are able to seek out and destroy infected cells, as well as regulate the activity of other immune cells. Like B Cells, T cells are born in the bone marrow, however they must travel to the Thymus (a lymphoid organ just above the heart) in order to mature. In the thymus, immature T cells, also called Thymocytes, differentiate and grow into mature T cells. Each of these cells express T cell receptors (TCR) on their surface that are specific for a single antigen. Every TCR on a single T cell is specific for the same antigen, however through a complex process of gene rearrangement, each one of the millions of individual T cells express a different TCR that is unique to a specific antigen.

These mature T cells can be broadly separated into CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells) and CD4+ T cells (helper T cells). CD8+ T cells are considered “killer” cells because their job is to induce the death of target cells that have been internally infected by a pathogen or are expressing aberrant proteins. They induce death in target cells by punching holes the target cell's membrane and injecting molecules that activate the apoptotic pathway. Unfortunately, this mechanism of killing is therefore ineffective for cancer cells with mutated p53, which explains in part why tumors are often able to evade immune destruction. Tumor cells take control of these apoptosis signals, making it almost impossible for them to kill themselves.

CD4+ T cells are separated into a number of different subsets, however their effector function can be generalized as secreting cytokines which orchestrate the activity of B cells, Macrophages, and other T cells. In order to execute these functions, the mature T cells must first be activated by binding to antigen. The TCR is not actually capable of binding to its specific antigen on its own, instead the antigen must be presented to it by an Antigen Presenting Cell (APC).

In the case of CD4+ T cells, there are only three types of cells which can act as APCs: Dendritic Cells, Macrophages, and B cells. When one of these cells come in contact with exogenous antigen (antigen that is not already inside of a cell) they will absorb it, process it, and then present it on the cell surface using a molecule called the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II. When antigen is presented in this way, the TCR on CD4+ cells will bind to it, which induces proliferation and effector function.* While most of these effector cells only last for a few weeks, some are differentiated to become memory cells, which will reside in the lymph nodes indefinitely—allowing for a more immediate a dramatically more powerful immune response to any subsequent infection by that antigen (Figure 3). As we age however, these memory T-cells accumulate and may become non-functional. This, as well as a decrease in naive T-cell production, contributes to immunosenescence, and partially explains why the immune systems of adults are less likely to catch a eliminate a growing tumor.  

*This is what was happening during B-cell activation. When the B-cell processed antigen and bound to T-cells in order to be activated, it was actually simultaneously stimulating the T-cell. In this way B-cells and T-cells interact to activate one another. 



Figure 3. Generalized diagram depicting the faster and more powerful response mounted by the immune system upon re-exposure to an antigen. 

A similar method of activation is used by CD8+ T cells, except that they recognized MHC class I instead of MHC class II molecules. MHC class I is expressed constitutively by nearly every cell in the body, and only presents endogenous antigen (existing inside of the cell). This system is extremely useful in the context of cancer because it gives the body a way to recognize and kill cells that are producing aberrant proteins—a sign that the cell has damaged DNA and may be cancerous. In fact, suppressing the expression of MHC class I is one tactic cancer cells use to evade the constant immunosurveillance by CD8+ T-cells.

Draft. Innate Immunity

This technical guide is divided into several sub-pages:

Key Players
Inflammation Response
Local and Regional Phases of Elimination
How Does it Go Wrong?



Key Players 


Innate immunity are the cellular components of the immune system that are naturally endowed with the ability to recognize pathogens or abnormal cells and do not require previous exposure to them like in the adaptive immune system. In contrast to the adaptive arm, the innate arm of the immune system is much faster (response in seconds to minutes), has stereotyped targets, and mostly acts on extra-cellular ligands. Cells of the innate arm include:



Macrophage
Phagocytic cells
Originate in the bone marrow and are highly mobile
Release angiogenic factors, mitogens, glycosylases, and proteases
Dendritic Cells (Langerhans)
Antigen presenting cells which process antigen material and present it to the surface of the cell to the T cells
Messengers between innate and adaptive immunity
Identify what is in tissue and carry it to lymph nodes
Granulocytes
Basophils-mediates hypersensitivity
Eosinophil- motile phagocyte; can migrate from blood to tissues and displays IgE receptors
Neutrophil-Responsible for recognizing and engulfing infectious
Engulf any bacteria that is present; dump huge amounts of peroxide on it
Forms free radicals killing bacteria and neutrophil
Mass of dead bacteria and neutrophils compiles into puss
Platelets - degranulation of platelets is the first sign to the innate immune system
Triggering clotting is a signal to recruit neutrophils

Natural Killer T cell
Similar properties of both T cells and natural killer cells
Recognize CD1
Attach, secrete perferins to cut a hole
Secrete Granzymes that trigger apoptosis
Mast Cells
Found in connective tissue
Contain basophil granules
Responsible for releasing histamines, heparin, etc. during allergic or inflammatory responses
Natural Killer Cells
Function is host rejection of tumors and virally infected cells
Complement Protein
Phagocytic macrophages release cytokines and chemokines in response to pathogens
These chemicals induce the inflammatory reaction within the body
Inflammation may also be triggered due to general presence of bacteria
Calor, rubor, tumor, dolor - inflammation
Causes dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels → aids in the recruitment of immune cells to fight pathogen
𝛾δT cell
Unique T cell receptor(TCR) cells
Phagocytes and antigen presenting

Draft. Organization of Genome
Key Concept 1: Methylation - CpG islands


In DNA there are regions where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide in a linear sequence of bases in a 5' to 3' direction. 
CpG - cytosine and guanine that are separated by one phosphate; phosphates link any two nucleosides together in DNA formation.



Figure 1: 5'-C-phosphate-G-3'- Cytosine and Guanine separated by a single phosphate, DNA stand (left) and complementary base pairing (right). Note: always 5' to 3' direction. 

Methylation of CpG sites - Alternative methylation of CpG sites can either hide or expose a gene to allow its expression to change proportionally. This change in expression can throw off the cell in a way that causes cancer.
Cytosines in 70% to 80% of mammals are methylated and this forms 5-methylcytosine. Methylating the cytosine in a gene can alternate the its expression.
The enzymes that add this methyl group to the cytosine are known as DNA methyltransferases. 
Methylation of CpG sites followed by a spontaneous removal of an amino group (deamination) leads to a lack of CpG sites in methylated DNA. This results in the formation of CpG islands. CpG islands are created in areas where methylation is rare. The process is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Methylation of CpG sites followed by spontaneous deamination. 

CpG islands - regions with a high frequency of CpG sites. Typically 300-3,000 base pairs in length. 
Many CpG islands associated with the mammalian genome are closely associated with the start of the gene or the promoter region - this helps us realize that CpG islands are used to help predict the annotation of genes.
Multiple methylated CpG sites in CpG islands of promoters causes stable silencing of genes. 
During cancer the loss of expression of genes occurs more frequently by the hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands than by mutations that occur in the gene.


Key Concept 2: Intron/exon-genes and alternative splicing 




In the genome there are different regions, exons and introns (depicted in Figure 1 as well): 

The exon region is the coding region that will actually be transcribed and translated into proteins.
Introns are between these coding regions and they themselves do not code for anything. 
They can range in size from 10 to 1000 base pairs
Provide an almost buffer to help decrease the frequency of mutation.

Figure 1: Demonstrating the effect of a mutation in the exon (coding region) as compared to that in the "junk" region (intron) and the severity the change can have. 

When DNA is transcribed, both the intron and exons are present in the pre-mRNA. To create the mature RNA (just exons) that will be used in translation to make the protein: 

The pre-mRNA undergoes splicing to make the final mRNA: 
RNA splicing is carried out by small nuclear ribonucleotides (snRNPs) which bind to both 5’ and 3’ end of the intron causing a loop to form.  
The intron can then be removed from the sequence and the exons are linked together.
Introns have be removed exactly  or will affect the protein produced. Otherwise a frameshift will occur and cause the wrong the wrong codon to be placed in the amino sequence. 

Figure 2: Demonstrates the process in which premature mRNA (mRNA transcript) is spliced into the mature mRNA (labeled mRNA in the figure). 

Alternative splicing occurs when one gene is recombined to make a variety of proteins. This allows for biodiversity but can cause abnormal proteins. Having abnormal proteins can lead to problems such as an enzyme not being able to be turned off (lack of being able to de-phosphorylation, etc.). 
Figure 3: Depicts how even depending on the tissue, the same sequence of DNA can be alternatively spliced to produce a variety of proteins. 

Key Concept 3: DNA damage and the irrevocable damage it can cause: 


Other problems that can cause damage that may become irreversible if not fixed properly by DNA repair mechanisms are discussed in Hallmark 3 subpage 3 (DNA Repair Mechanisms). 

The types of DNA damage can occur: 
Intrinsic mutations -(stuff happens), something that happens not caused by outside sources 
Extrinsic mutations is caused by outside sources 
examples of these would include UV damage or interlocutors. 

Figure 4: Shows the severity of the interlocutor thalidomide, causing many children like this kindergarten boy to be born with phocomelia, which results in the shortening or absence of limbs. (URL: https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/thalidomide-tragedy-lessons-drug-safety-and-regulation)

In all, if these alterations are left untreated and replicated again for cell division they then can become permanent alterations. 
Location of the alteration can determine the severity of the mistake. 
If the alteration is in the intron, the mutation may not be expressed in the production of that protein (will be excised during RNA splicing) 
If the damage is in the exon and causes an alternate codon to be added to the sequence, the protein can alter or completely lose function. 

Key Concept 4: Promoter regions and the effects of distance 

Promoter- region of DNA sequence that flags where transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase should start. 
Typically upstream to the initiation site. 
Promoter joined with the proper transcription factors, transcription can begin. 
An example of a promoter region: 
The TATA box: 
which typically is located 25-35 base pairs upstream of the initiation site. 

Figure 5: Demonstrates the process by which a promoter signals for the transcription factors and then the RNA Polymerase to begin transcription. (URL: http://hannahspirosbi4u.blogspot.com/2014_12_01_archive.html)

Distance of the promoter region to the initiation sequence: 
can determine how frequently a gene will be transcribed 
closer to the promoter creates a higher probability the gene will be transcribed by RNA polymerase.
This determines if a gene is under or over-expressed
splicing of promoter regions closer or farther from the gene therefore will cause the gene to be over/under-expressed 
which can alter cell function 
example: p53 plays a major role in cell cycle regulation. Over or under-expression of the gene can alter if the cell cycle will be regulated correctly or not. 
Enhancer regions - aid in promotion of a gene; over enhancement can throw off cell cycle and lead to cancer.

Enhancers work as cis-regulatory elements in order to mediate spatial and temporal control of development through the initiation of transcription. Particular combinations of transcription factors  and other DNA-binding proteins control which genes will be expressed in that particular tissue.
Enhancers allow the same gene to be used in a variety of diverse processes.

Enhancer Region Video

Video: A second set of transcription factors called coactivators link the basal factors with a third set of transcription factor proteins called activators. Activators are regulatory proteins that bind to sequences on DNA called enhancers. Enhancers are located at sites that are distant from the promoter. The interaction of activator proteins with transcription factor subunits increases the rate of transcription.
Many enhancers, scattered around the chromosome, can bind different activators, which provide a variety of responses to various signals.

Key Concept 5: Transposable elements
Transposable elements are pieces of parasitic DNA that have the ability to splice themselves out of the genome and reinsert themselves elsewhere in the genome. They have inverted terminal repeats on either end (fig. 1) that allow them to bind to themselves in order to twist themselves out of the genome. 
Figure 1. The transposable element includes a coding area and terminal repeats that allow it to bind to itself.

The activator protein coded for within the transposable element is crucial to its ability to move, as it does the physical work of activating the transposon and splicing it out. If there is no activator protein coded for within the transposon, the activator proteins of another transposon will often allow it to still move within the genome. 
Once a transposon has been spliced out of the genome, it can to any spot on any chromosome. When it does move into the genome it can insert into the middle of a coding region of a gene and disrupt the gene (fig. 2)
Figure 2. Transposable elements can insert into a gene and disrupt it. 

If a transposable element by chance inserted into the coding region or promoter region of a tumor suppressor gene such as Rb or P53, the protein resulting from that gene would be disrupted. This would render the protein useless and the loss of these regulatory proteins within the cell could cause the cell to lose control of its proliferative process and become cancerous.
