You shouldn’t include the title of articles in the in-text citation (you may in other fields, but not in scientific writing). I am interesting in hearing more about the murky water environment and why you think the fish will be less aggressive in it.

"9231","outgroup","ingroup","It means your hypothesis is rejected and you fail to reject the null hypothesis"
"9232","outgroup","ingroup","State your actual hypothesis before you state the results, and then you can have a concluding sentence where you state that your hypothesis was not supported (don’t mention the null though)"
"9233","ingroup","outgroup","This should be a colon :, not a comma"
"9234","outgroup","outgroup","This should definitely come earlier in the discussion before you talk about errors, as this is a great explanation for why your results occurred, so I would talk more about this. Also, end your discussion with a concluding sentence"

"9240","ingroup","outgroup","Just say since the beginning that five gastrocnemius muscles were used in this experiment"
"9241","outgroup","ingroup","As this is the abstract, you can be a bit vague with the citation and leave it as “in a previous study…” and leave out the in-text."
"9242","ingroup","ingroup","Because the same legs served as the experimental and control, I would recommend a paired t-test instead."
"9243","outgroup","ingroup","If there were any trends observed, I would include a sentence or 2 about that as well (from your results)."

"9252","ingroup","outgroup","Just put your p-value somewhere in here"
"9253","outgroup","outgroup","Not necessarily. If you look on google scholar for some articles about lanthanum chloride, you’ll find there are a few legitimate reasons for why your results occurred. Always explore all the options before attributing your results to error!"
"9254","ingroup","ingroup","Ok, so this is a bit too detailed for the methods section, as you describe actual thresholds in the leg. You can describe in general how the threshold was found (i.e. when muscle contraction could be visualized on LabScribe, we considered the stimulator voltage to be the twitch threshold), but that should be it. Then you can explain that you measured the contraction amplitude at that voltage"

"9257","ingroup","outgroup","You don’t really need the concentration here, as that’s not part of the name of the chemical"
"9258","ingroup","ingroup","You don’t really need this part, as it’s obvious what your standard deviations are from above. And as long as you state that the error bars are standard deviations in your figure caption, you don’t need te last part either"
"9259","ingroup","outgroup","If you include a figure number in the image, make sure it matches the number in the submission. This should be “Figure 2” now."

"9275","outgroup","outgroup","This is confusing"
"9276","ingroup","outgroup","What was the concentration?"
"9277","outgroup","ingroup","Why does the contraction voltage matter?  Why is it the data you are running the t-test on and why should a bad p-value render all of your data insignificant? Your hypothesis was tetany, not contraction voltage so you should be running a t-test on something related to tetany to validate the tetany results, rather than the contraction voltage.  Let me know if you are confused."
"9278","ingroup","ingroup","How so? In which processes are light energy involved? Be specific."
"9279","outgroup","outgroup","If full sunlight have the largest R:S, doesn’t that mean that plants are allocating more energy to roots than shoots?"
"9280","outgroup","outgroup","Interesting, but I’m not really sure how it relates to your hypothesis."
"9281","outgroup","outgroup","Never quote primary literature!"
"9282","ingroup","outgroup","Provide the specific means and SDs"
"9283","outgroup","outgroup","What does salt resistance have to do with your study?"
"9284","ingroup","outgroup","Your caption should be made up of separate sentences"
"9285","ingroup","ingroup","According to your formula (before - after treatment) this value should be positive because the contraction was stronger before the injection. So correct this."

"9291","ingroup","ingroup","Main problem, you are saying what you did, like in the methods. That is not part of the discussion. Just focus on mentioning the obtained result and trying to explain that with the effect of lidocaine on Na+ channels and how this is influencing the contractionCitations are needed in this section"
"9292","ingroup","ingroup","The maximum voltage? Are you sure?"

"9304","outgroup","ingroup","Try to reorganize this. Maybe give me the biology first, introduce the idea of adding salt along with primary literature, then tell me what DCPIP is and why you’re using it. The sentence about DCPIP that’s in there seems misplaced."

"9324","ingroup","ingroup","You don’t need a title here, but you do need to be more specific with your legend descriptors (0 mM of?) and add error bars! You should also have your time zero points on here."

"9326","ingroup","ingroup","Are you sure? How many drops did you add? 1 drop = 50uL, so for 1mL you should add 20 drops. Was that your doses? If not, then do the corresponding calculations."

The key point here is to explain that there were differences in their coloration at the end of the experiment between groups."
"9339","outgroup","ingroup","Why did you predict this? Check your lab manual information or other sources. Higher levels of JH inhibit pupation, but stimulate the molting to another larval stage.
