1,3_technical,4_specific,The commitment pulse occurs during the 5th larval stage
2,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is not a scientific term
3,3_technical,4_specific,Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.
4,3_technical,4_specific,I would rather focus on improving the procedure to isolate the chloroplast rather than doing 30 replicate per treatment
5,3_technical,4_specific,"What is the stimuli to open Ca++ channels, the arrival of an AP or the opening of K+ channels? You should be precise."
6,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Try something like, “The average R:S ratio for weight of sun plants was 0.635 ± 0.223”"
7,2_writing,4_specific,"This goes in methods, but why’d you use paired? I don’t think it’s appropriate for your data, so please reach out and ask me questions if you need help!"
8,2_writing,4_specific,"Instead of saying that the obtained results were opposite to the expected results, just mention the observed trends in the data. That is what you got, mention that first and then later you can mention that it goes against the predicton."
9,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Just refer to the study, not the author."

11,2_writing,1_pointer,Typo?
12,3_technical,4_specific,"Directed hypothesis = one-tailed, and the hypothesis you state above is one-tailed. Clarify please."
13,3_technical,4_specific,Which statistical test(s) did you run?
14,1_basic,4_specific,"We talked about this is class, but you cannot mention or discuss your hypothesis (or whether or not it is supported) in the results. This belongs in the discussion and is an organizational issue. Given that the rest of this report is very good, fixing this error will allow you to still get a good overall grade on your revision, but please come see me if you are confused."
15,3_technical,4_specific,"These is telling you that you probably don’t need so many figures because they are showing the same information, so you could combine them"
16,2_writing,8_nobasis,specify
17,3_technical,4_specific,You need another citation. The lab manual only is not enough.
18,4_logic,3_general,Don’t attribute your results to error
19,2_writing,3_general,Do not quote previous studies. Explain their observations with your own words.
20,4_logic,3_general,Also explore the possible reasons why your herbicide experiment didn’t turn out the way you expected
21,4_logic,3_general,You need to expand far more in your discussion. Talk about future directions and expand on your explanation of your data.
22,4_logic,3_general,"Your discussion needs to talk about the implications of your results, whether your hypothesis was supported, and give a biological reason for your results"
23,1_basic,3_general,No interpretation. Just trends
24,3_technical,4_specific,"Ah, so a good control here would have been covering the control PDA plates with water and allowing them to soak for 10 minutes too."
25,3_technical,4_specific,You need to include also the difference between groups. That was also in the figure
26,3_technical,2_copyedit,Ca++ is released from…
27,3_technical,2_copyedit,Can you use a more scientific term?
28,3_technical,3_general,Can you just generalize the methods a little bit more.
29,3_technical,2_copyedit,R:S for length? Weight? Both?
30,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formattingOmit this
31,3_technical,7_idiomatic,"Nitpicking: citation first, then period"
32,2_writing,2_copyedit,It was hypothesized…

34,2_writing,3_general,informal
35,3_technical,4_specific,What does this mean? Check your statistical terms and be precise.
36,4_logic,3_general,Why you hate on poor blue? (Tell me why this makes sense.)
37,3_technical,4_specific,Use a figure instead of two tables and only display the means with the standard deviation depicted by error bars. Come see me if you need help with excel.
38,2_writing,4_specific,This is irrelevant information. Start by explaining the underlying biological concept of your study (i.e. intraspecific aggression)
39,3_technical,3_general,Include volumes
40,2_writing,2_copyedit,extract
41,3_technical,4_specific,"Where is the description of the weight and length data? The statistical outcome should corroborate the observations, it will determine if the differences were caused by chance or if there was an effect, but before mentioning the statistical analysis you should mention the direct observations."
42,3_technical,4_specific,What is muscle preparation?
43,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This section could be much more concise by just saying something like “xxx was not significantly different than yyy (p = 0.637, Figure 1)”"
44,3_technical,2_copyedit,Where’s your figure reference?
45,3_technical,4_specific,Why did you use a different number of drops? The treatment and control conditions should be similar in terms of the amount.
46,2_writing,4_specific,This explanation should come before you talk about changes in root:shoot
47,2_writing,3_general,confusing
48,4_logic,2_copyedit,What was your main hypothesis. Make sure to include your hypothesis as one of the first sentence in your abstract.
49,1_basic,3_general,You also need primary literature in your discussion section
50,2_writing,4_specific,Keep your background info focused on R:S
51,3_technical,4_specific,Need to have error bars on your graphs. Need to have correct x axis labels. See me if you need help
52,1_basic,4_specific,Make sure to include outside sources in the introduction (Basic Criteria).
53,1_basic,4_specific,"Talking about your hypothesis should go in your discussion section, not your results section. You can say your p-value is significant, but no more than that"
54,2_writing,3_general,No citations in abstract
55,3_technical,2_copyedit,"When reporting the results of a two-sample t-test, you need to include the resulting t-statistic, the degrees of freedom (df), and the corresponding P-value. Your statement might look like this, “The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.57, df = 26, P = 0.574).”"
56,2_writing,3_general,This is a little confusing. Try to break this up into smaller chucks when explaining
57,2_writing,3_general,Don’t use hyperbole in scientific writing.
58,2_writing,4_specific,"This belongs in the methods, not the intro. Just begin your intro with the next sentence."

62,3_technical,2_copyedit,provide molarity
63,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical testing did you use?
64,2_writing,4_specific,You need to start the discussion with this sentence
65,3_technical,6_holistic,"I think if the only thing you have to say about this figure in your results is that there’s nothing really going on, it’s probably not worth including"
66,4_logic,4_specific,"This is not what it means. It means the data is insignificant, regardless of its relevance to the experiment"
67,3_technical,4_specific,You need a y-axis label
68,3_technical,2_copyedit,SD?
69,4_logic,4_specific,"Because you stated that your statistical test said the change in mass were not statistically different, this essentially states that the difference in mass for your experimental and control could have been by random chance. As such, you should treat them as being the same or at least very similar. Due to this, you would have to come to the conclusion that statistically, there was no effect of precor on Manduca growth."
70,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Reduce your significant digits, same for t-value"
71,2_writing,3_general,informal
72,3_technical,2_copyedit,"We used an incubator, not a fridge"
73,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much will you inject?
74,3_technical,3_general,Describe all the results citing figures and t-test p-values.
75,2_writing,3_general,You also tend to write really short sentences that makes your report read really choppy. Adding detail will help with this. So ask yourself “why” and “how” to help you out.
76,3_technical,2_copyedit,conspecific
77,2_writing,4_specific,You may want to mention this earlier in your discussion.
78,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If consecutive sentences use the same citation, you can just cite it at the end of the last sentence."
79,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
80,3_technical,2_copyedit,Why don’t you look up what that muscle is called
81,3_technical,4_specific,"Which type of t-test?But more importantly, why did you use different # of tails for the tests? What in your hypothesis makes this a valid approach, I only see a two-tailed hypothesis? You should either clarify your hypothesis, or use the two-tailed t-test for both the weight and length ratios."
82,3_technical,2_copyedit,2% water agar
83,3_technical,8_nobasis,What do you mean?
84,2_writing,2_copyedit,The statistical outcome is not necessary in the Abstract.
85,3_technical,4_specific,What volume and concentration of reagents were used in the experiment?
86,3_technical,2_copyedit,Error bars?

89,3_technical,4_specific,Did you sterilize anything?
90,2_writing,3_general,Do not quote previous studies
91,3_technical,3_general,All information that is not common knowledge needs to be cited.
92,4_logic,4_specific,"If the roots are more massive, can we conclude that nutrients are actually being allocated to the shoots?"
93,3_technical,4_specific,This label should have more. How many frogs did you use? What do error bars represent? What is the trend of the graph? What are your statistical results?
94,3_technical,3_general,This is not the title of the lab report. The title should give an idea of the experiment
95,4_logic,6_holistic,Did they always fight to the death? Would selection really favor the death of closely related individuals?
96,2_writing,2_copyedit,Specifically… (You’re not deducing all of signaling in this lab.)
97,4_logic,6_holistic,For manduca sexta is it better to keep in in a pupal phase or an adult?
98,3_technical,2_copyedit,Paired t-test
99,3_technical,4_specific,The null hypothesis cannot be rejected. (The null hypothesis would be that tubocurarine has no effect on the muscle).
100,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would try to include the number of pulses and the width (how long the stimulus lasted).
101,4_logic,4_specific,"Only talk about mutualism, the others are impertinent to your study"
102,2_writing,4_specific,You need a hypothesis in your abstract
103,3_technical,6_holistic,Does it just diffuse?
104,2_writing,3_general,The intro needs to be reorganized and portions need to be clarified
105,3_technical,4_specific,The figure caption could have some more info…specify “shade” or “full sun” instead of control and experimental. And a brief description of the methods used
106,2_writing,4_specific,These are really more methods than results
107,3_technical,2_copyedit,You don’t need this. You already analyzed the p-value.
108,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
109,3_technical,3_general,How? It is super important that someone can read this and replicate your experiment exactly!
110,3_technical,4_specific,Use the average of these values/column to make your graph.
111,3_technical,8_nobasis,What is this made of?
112,4_logic,3_general,Why are you asking this question? What do we need to know to answer it?
113,4_logic,3_general,Why is there a clear difference? Can you support that statement?
114,3_technical,2_copyedit,refer to correct format in the precious comment
115,4_logic,4_specific,I guess what isn’t totally clear is why is 21 degrees C your control? Make that more explicit—is it an optimal temperature for photosynthesis?
116,4_logic,4_specific,"You spend a lot of time talking about error here. It’s good to be up front about possible defects in your data, but only if you think they really had an effect on the outcome of the experiment. For example, I’m not sure the fish eating the soil is an ERROR, it’s just something that happened in the experiment. You could mention it as an interesting observation rather than a mistake."
117,2_writing,3_general,revise
118,3_technical,4_specific,Check d.f. value
119,2_writing,4_specific,"No need to explain specific aggressive behaviors in your introduction. Instead, focus your introduction on explaining intraspecific aggression, experimental treatments, and their connection."
120,4_logic,3_general,What is the bigger picture?
121,2_writing,3_general,This should have explored a bit further.
122,3_technical,2_copyedit,Be sure to refer to the figures here
123,2_writing,2_copyedit,Test species would be formal
124,2_writing,2_copyedit,hemolymph
125,2_writing,6_holistic,"This is what I meant by introducing biological background info pertinent to your experiment. I don’t need to know about the special pairs, but I do need to know about plastoquinone."
126,2_writing,3_general,"This abstract needs to be reformatted a little bit. Think two sentences for your intro, your hypothesis, one sentence for methods, two for results, and a short concluding sentence"
127,3_technical,4_specific,All of them or are you referring to Martin’s IGR?
128,1_basic,4_specific,Don’t state this until the discussion
129,4_logic,3_general,This mechanism is a little bit different than what you talked about in the introduction section
130,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I need to see some values in here other than p-value, don’t just describe the averages and standard devs show me them"
131,3_technical,3_general,could have summarized better because it is still recipe-style writing
132,2_writing,6_holistic,"Break this giant run-on into several, smaller sentences. Simpler sentences are typically better."
133,1_basic,4_specific,"This is close to interpretation (you are still explaining why you think something happened, not just what you saw happen). I’m going to allow it this time because I know you worked very hard to not put any interpretation in these results, but it’s an important point for you to understand in the future."
134,2_writing,6_holistic,"All the time? Be specific, please"
135,2_writing,4_specific,Write PKA in parenthesis since you referred to it as PKA later
136,2_writing,4_specific,End with a nice concluding sentence here
137,3_technical,3_general,Refer to your figures.
138,3_technical,3_general,Citations for this section?
139,2_writing,6_holistic,Ending a statement with proposition is considered to be informal. Use your best judgement to locate your informal/colloquial terms and revise.
140,3_technical,3_general,"This is raw data, you don’t need to include it."
141,3_technical,3_general,Include this in paragraph form in your results
142,4_logic,6_holistic,What do you think went wrong with your experiment? Why do you think the Manduca did not do what you thought?
143,3_technical,3_general,This is not enough for a figure caption
144,4_logic,4_specific,Is this always true?
145,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? The relevance of your results for the insecticides market is not very clear.
146,3_technical,4_specific,"As an alpha value of 0.05 (95% confidence) is standard, an alpha value does not need to be stated unless a value different from this standard is used."
147,2_writing,3_general,informal

150,3_technical,2_copyedit,control
151,3_technical,2_copyedit,Specify the studied physiological process
152,2_writing,4_specific,I would move this to the methods section as it’s more specific to your experiment than knowledge about the Manduca.
153,3_technical,3_general,At least 2 citations are needed. You can use lab manual for your background information.
154,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Error bars are correct this time, although there’s no need to fill in the bars with that pattern. Also it’s odd that the bars are all the way on the left side of the graph…see me if you need help making graphs"
155,4_logic,6_holistic,"Any primary literature sources (journal articles) that deal with interspecific interactions involving betta fish? It would be very useful to cite and talk about those here, if there are."
156,2_writing,1_pointer,?
157,3_technical,2_copyedit,This caption is too conversational and not didactic enough.This caption needs to tell me what the error bars mean as well.
158,3_technical,4_specific,Citation?
159,3_technical,3_general,"This is redundant, a graph is a visual representation"
160,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Check spelling throughout:ResourcesThere = theirWhere = wereAll of the blue underlines need to be corrected, they indicate areas where you have used the wrong word."
161,4_logic,4_specific,This is not necessary. Focus more in the biological explanations
162,3_technical,4_specific,"A paired t-test is more appropriate for your data, as it takes into account the fact that you used the same fish for both treatments."
163,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Figures look great, but captions need to include stats and description of error bars"
164,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
165,4_logic,4_specific,"Do you think this would have affected length differently than weight? Otherwise, this is  weak argument. The shade cloth did let some light through (about 25%)."
166,4_logic,6_holistic,"Why would methoprene cause a weight gain, what is the correlation there?"
167,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t need this
168,3_technical,4_specific,"The y-axis is so large that your results are not clear – scale it down so that your bars appear taller. Also, your data are ratios, right? Is there a more accurate and informative y-axis label that you could use? Right now it appears that you are showing the total height and total weight of the plants, which I don’t think is your goal."
169,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?
170,3_technical,3_general,Pay particular attention to your figure and figure caption for tips on how to include one in your presentations
171,3_technical,3_general,"This table is okay because the data is presented well, and only relevant data is included, but this is basically still raw data. Can you think of a way to represent this graphically, perhaps?"
172,2_writing,4_specific,"Again, you really just mean the muscle. Saying this is like saying taking caffeine would make the workout machine say I’m lifting heavier weights."
173,4_logic,4_specific,"I don’t understand how is this study explaining your results. What is your interpretation based on what they did? If you can make the link between this study and the study of the other researchers, then it will be more clear."
174,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is a citation!  Just need to cite it and have use an in-text citation.
175,3_technical,4_specific,Think about your x-axis label. Is that really what the x-axis is showing?
176,3_technical,4_specific,"You didn’t measure UV here, you used sun vs. shade. Sunlight contains other wavelengths of light aside from UV."
177,4_logic,4_specific,"While possible, I’m hesitant to say that the marginal increase in soil temp would elicit such a dramatic response."
178,3_technical,3_general,Follow the formatting instructions in the citation formatting section (page 51) to construct your citation lists and in-text citations.
179,4_logic,3_general,There is no prediction in your hypothesis. Reformulate the hypothesis including the prediction.
180,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Be careful with using the word significantly, as that generally implies you had statistically significant data"
181,3_technical,4_specific,you need to justify it by backing it up with primary lit
182,3_technical,4_specific,You had 2. Control vs Experimental.
183,1_basic,4_specific,This belongs in the discussion. NO interpretation in the results.
184,4_logic,4_specific,"I would highlight on the fact that A23187 targets both IP3 and Ca2+ activated intracellular channels. If 2-APB targets IP3, think about how you could improve your current experimental design."
185,3_technical,4_specific,for 50 min – talk about the final check done to test the viability of chlorosplasts
186,3_technical,2_copyedit,You need to refer readers to your figures as you mention the info they show in the results.
187,1_basic,3_general,You need primary literature in your introduction
188,2_writing,6_holistic,"“like” is an informal term, consider “such as” instead. Use your best judgement to locate informal/colloquial terms in the rest of the report and revise."
189,3_technical,4_specific,"Adding an x-axis label does not mean you should remove the labels clarifying which is control and which is experimental (“treated”). If you don’t wish to have too much text, you could also make control and experimental different colors and add a key showing what the different colors mean."
190,3_technical,6_holistic,That is not related with threshold. What is falling between the latent period and the point of maximum contraction? Reconsider the definition of contraction period in the myogram.
191,3_technical,4_specific,The physical labeling process isn’t needed as labeling them differently or not even having a label (and having a separate way to differentiate the worms) would not affect the reproducibility of the experiment.
192,3_technical,4_specific,"Describe the results and data of the controls and include observations not presented in a formal figure or table, if appropriate."
193,4_logic,4_specific,How would cold affect enzyme function?
194,2_writing,4_specific,Leave this for the discussion.
195,3_technical,4_specific,Where is the statistical analysis?
196,4_logic,4_specific,Need some more discussion of the biological mechanisms here. How does green light affect length?

198,2_writing,3_general,No quotes
199,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much and what is this made of?
200,3_technical,3_general,You need to specifically mention whether or not there was significant difference in treatments
201,4_logic,6_holistic,You need to elaborate on your experimental treatment. How might turbidity affect aggression? Cite some relevant studies.
202,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I would make your title about weight, since that is what you measured"
203,2_writing,3_general,This was a really nice complete introduction but try to summarize a little bit more the previous lit. You don’t need to go so in depth into their methods

212,2_writing,3_general,informal
213,4_logic,4_specific,Procedural error could be one reason. Maybe the chloroplasts were not successfully isolated. Recall that you did not actually look through the microscope and calculated relative chloroplast density this time. It could be error at maintaining the temp during the experiments. Explore possible reasons!
214,4_logic,4_specific,"Why would those be logical next steps, how would you test them? You did test ACh in the muscle so what were you going to do differently?"
215,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I believe we talked about error bars in class, so you should be good for the revision, but don’t forget to change them!"
216,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you have a colon : between the author and the year
217,3_technical,2_copyedit,Specify that this was for stimulation
218,2_writing,2_copyedit,"This sentence is realllly complicated and there are a lot of clauses. Can you distill it down, or break it into two sentences? It’s hard to understand what you are saying."
219,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You don’t need to cite every sentence.  If you have a few sentences in a row that are from the same citation, you would just leave an intext citation after the group of sentences."
220,2_writing,4_specific,Hypothesis needs to be the last sentence of your introduction.
221,2_writing,3_general,These say similar things. Combine them.
222,3_technical,4_specific,"Your hypothesis was about R:S, but you are mixing up R:S and “overall mass” here. Need to give the actual p value"
223,3_technical,2_copyedit,two-sample
224,2_writing,4_specific,Can wait until methods. Too much details for the introduction.
225,3_technical,6_holistic,Do you think is necessary to explain this or is something you need to know to conduct the analysis?
226,3_technical,4_specific,"Why? Unpaired, correct?"
227,3_technical,4_specific,You don’t need this table with averages because this is basically what your graph is displaying
228,4_logic,4_specific,"This is a good connection.Your introduction is sparse and doesn’t set up your research question very well. You don’t mention anything about resource allocation or phenotypic plasticity, for example. You should fill this out more by explaining these concepts, and then talking about why you think salinity in particular will affect R:S ratios."
229,3_technical,3_general,"The format of your list should be the same. Eg. MLA, APA etc."
230,3_technical,2_copyedit,Mention standard deviation

247,4_logic,3_general,"Yes, there are many explanations. Look for examples in the literature. E.g. find papers about how color affects aggression"
248,4_logic,6_holistic,"This is good but I want to see you go deeper. Think biological reasoning for why calcium channel activator *could*, *not* promote growth toward calcium. Um…see me in lab about this because I’m pretty sure this comment made zero sense and I can’t make it make sense right now."

253,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? What motivates intraspecific aggression? What are its costs and benefits? You need to be specific
254,3_technical,2_copyedit,Water was added

273,4_logic,3_general,This doesn’t have any support backing it.
274,3_technical,4_specific,Can you be more specific than response? That was the amplitude of contraction
275,2_writing,3_general,This abstract still has no hypothesis in it.
276,4_logic,3_general,Also explore the possible reasons why your herbicide experiment didn’t turn out the way you expected
277,2_writing,2_copyedit,This means that you are repeating information.
278,3_technical,4_specific,"Martin’s IGR is a JH activator, not an inhibitor. You didn’t test both, so this is not true."
279,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?
280,2_writing,4_specific,This is too detailed for the introduction. Saying Martin’s IGR is enough for the sake of the introduction.
281,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars. As such, this graph should have 16 total standard deviation bars."
282,3_technical,2_copyedit,Ask me or one of your group members to help you with how to properly make your graphs
283,3_technical,2_copyedit,Did you have a control group or the same muscles were stimulated before and after injection? Consider saying control condition
284,3_technical,2_copyedit,Paired t-test
285,3_technical,4_specific,This is not true. The bar does not represent the food. I t represents the average length of fur caterpillars treated with IGR.

294,3_technical,4_specific,I’m confused—why do you have two p-values here?
295,2_writing,3_general,Proofread
296,3_technical,2_copyedit,Delete. This information is essentially displayed in your bar graph. So no need for this
297,3_technical,4_specific,So I don’t know if you incorporated the new data I gave you in here but make sure you do if you haven’t already
298,2_writing,3_general,revise
299,3_technical,4_specific,"This is confusing, get right to if it is accepted or not and focus on the hypothesis not the null hypothesis. What told you it was significant?"
300,2_writing,1_pointer,Language….
301,3_technical,4_specific,"So, yes your p-value means insignificant data, but you then talk about what should happen. This is the correct way to go but you need to elaborate on what azamax should do and how it could have produced the data you saw."
302,3_technical,2_copyedit,I think you mixed up the order of your figure captions and figures (not something to worry too much about just be aware)
303,3_technical,3_general,Your figure caption should relay what you want me to get out of looking at this figure.
304,3_technical,4_specific,Why is the Manduca helpful to study?
305,2_writing,6_holistic,Are you sure it is the correct tense for this section? Check with other primary lit
306,2_writing,2_copyedit,You could omit this
307,4_logic,3_general,This seems counter to what you thought?
308,3_technical,4_specific,This is a very low doses.
309,3_technical,3_general,"Your statistical results still don’t need to be in a table, and need to be mentioned in your lab report in your results and discussion"
310,3_technical,4_specific,Your data does not look like it would be significant.  Try to run a t-test on the difference in weight/length between the first and last day of each manduca.  Let me know if you want clarification.
311,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what temp?
312,3_technical,3_general,Can you cite your source? This should apply to all established facts that are not your original work.
313,2_writing,4_specific,You can reconsider the order of the ideas in the Abstract. You are missing information about the results. Remember that the abstract could include information from all the lab report sections
314,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
315,3_technical,2_copyedit,Cross check again (technical error)
316,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way)."
317,2_writing,4_specific,This is an important point that should be re-iterated in your abstract as one of the concluding lines.
318,2_writing,6_holistic,"Consider this statement more carefully. Which concept is the cause, and which is the effect? What do you really mean by this? Your intro is somewhat unstructured. You go from broad statements to specific, and then back to broad again before narrowing on your hypothesis. How can you make this flow more smoothly?"
319,3_technical,4_specific,"You state a lot of data/observations in the discussion.  You should state them in the results, and reference them in the discussion. Also, you NEED to have a citation in the discussion that is not the lab manual."
320,3_technical,2_copyedit,Herbicide was your another treatment
321,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
322,2_writing,2_copyedit,Remove this
323,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is all unnecessary information
324,3_technical,2_copyedit,Edit it to simply read “Experimental” and “Control” (“Series 1” and “Series 2” are confusing). Let me know if you need help.
325,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (basic criteria)
326,4_logic,3_general,"Good job comparing to other studies. Focus on that in the future, instead of re-stating the results"
327,3_technical,2_copyedit,Leave out in-text citations for the abstract. Instead you can say something along the lines of “Previous studies have shown….”
328,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Just say that there was no significant difference (t = , df = , p =)"
329,3_technical,2_copyedit,Probably those values of the mean and SDare not necessary because that information is already I the figure

332,3_technical,4_specific,Include steps about how you prepared your dilution solution
333,3_technical,4_specific,"For all the results that were not significant, pick the ones that caught your attention and only include those."
334,3_technical,4_specific,"This is unclear. What do you mean by promote into adulthood, and your t-test says your data is significant so the precor you used was enough to do something."

336,3_technical,2_copyedit,To record the myograms of the muscles contractions
337,2_writing,3_general,This title needs to be more specific. Ask your lab mates or see me for suggestions.
338,3_technical,4_specific,Include mean ± SD for each group at the end of the experiment to support that statement. Include statistical outcome to corroborate if those difference were significant or not.
339,2_writing,3_general,Write your lab report as if you were trying to publish a study. Remember to start broadly.
340,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Should be 2018, as the lab manual was just updated!"
341,2_writing,8_nobasis,It is
342,3_technical,4_specific,"Mention the obtained result, that one that is supporting the hypothesis."
343,3_technical,2_copyedit,Lines a little hard to see.Use standard error here as well.
344,2_writing,2_copyedit,This would be a decent abstract if you deleted the first sentence.
345,4_logic,4_specific,"Your introduction doesn’t ever explain the reason plants allocate resources differentially, which makes it difficult for an inexperienced reader to understand your hypothesis."
346,3_technical,2_copyedit,You mean control?
347,2_writing,3_general,avoid using question mark statments
348,4_logic,4_specific,"Although you can mention that previous researchers found similar results than you by affecting the secretion of JH instead, I will recommend you look for another source."
349,2_writing,2_copyedit,"This supports your earlier claims, but it belongs earlier in the paper."
350,3_technical,3_general,"You can assume your reader understands basic statistics, so no need to explain p values."
351,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You reported this right, good job. You should also report the means +/- standard deviations and reference your figure(s) here."
352,2_writing,3_general,"I didn’t catch this before, but we can never prove things in science."
353,2_writing,1_pointer,?
354,3_technical,4_specific,Why are you focusing on the statistical tests in the figure captions? You should describe here the information that is displayed in the figures. Give details. Figure captions should be self-explanatory
355,2_writing,3_general,Almost sounds colloquial. Try a different word here
356,3_technical,2_copyedit,No sentences for just the p-vale. Write the results similar to the example that we analyzed in the last lab.
357,2_writing,4_specific,"There’s a lot in this sentence, can you unpack it a bit, and explain what R:S ratio is?"
358,3_technical,2_copyedit,What do your error bars represent?
359,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly). As such, this graph should have 16 total standard deviation bars."
360,2_writing,3_general,Avoid colloquial language
361,3_technical,2_copyedit,Save this for the Table caption

364,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (Basic Criteria)
365,4_logic,3_general,Do not assume that you did it wrong.
366,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data
367,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Avoid this. Since the stat’s weren’t significant, you can’t say that xxx was higher than yyy"
368,3_technical,4_specific,"Similarly, you hardly discuss your results in the discussion, instead explaining the reasoning for your hypothesis."
369,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Graphs look good, except you don’t need a title, and don’t need the legend"
370,2_writing,3_general,Good but try to make this more concise.
371,3_technical,4_specific,What am I supposed to take away from this figure?
372,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report the specific means +/- Sd
373,3_technical,4_specific,Potassium has a more specific role in nerves. The potassium channels open after Acetylcholine is released to try to hyperpolarize the cell and bring it back to resting potential.
374,3_technical,4_specific,These are essentially methods.
375,4_logic,3_general,What does this say about your hypothesis? What do you conclude?
376,3_technical,2_copyedit,Still days
377,4_logic,4_specific,"Instead of thinking that three replicates were too small, think about the procedure of isolating the chloroplast. Maybe there weren’t enough chloroplast in the samples because they weren’t isolated properly. You mentioned about it in later sentences. Three replicates is a standard sample size so I wouldn’t say that it is too small."
378,3_technical,4_specific,This should be included in the results section
379,3_technical,4_specific,What control?
380,3_technical,4_specific,This is not a valid citation for your experiment. That information in your Intro is completely irrelevant. Find another citation to explain the results.
381,3_technical,4_specific,Indicate how absorbance decrease relates to photosynthesis activity. Does it increase or decrease photosynthesis?
382,4_logic,6_holistic,"There’s a big jump here from talking about betta-betta interactions to betta-tetra interactions, and you don’t give the reader any background information as to why this is important or why we would expect bettas to react differently to other fish as opposed to other bettas. This information is key to putting your hypothesis into context – why do you expect to see less aggression in interspecific vs. intra?"
383,3_technical,2_copyedit,Exact amount (mL) and concentration of the chemical?
384,1_basic,4_specific,"Also, and reasoning needs to be done in your discussion and not your results. You can state observations, but wait to reason with them until the discussion."

390,4_logic,6_holistic,"I don’t think this is very important, certainly not as important as a deeper interpretation of your results. So you found that shelter decreases aggression, and now what does that mean for the fish, their fitness, and natural/artificial selection?"
391,3_technical,2_copyedit,Number your figures in the order to which you refer to them.
392,3_technical,3_general,This is still more than necessary to mention when talking about standard deviations but it’s okay this time
393,3_technical,4_specific,How are you defining authentic/unauthentic?
394,3_technical,4_specific,Need to show these data with just 2 bars. With the overall means instead of the means of each pot
395,3_technical,4_specific,"What were the data that you ran the test on – points for a single fish, or for the entire interaction (both fish)?A paired test is more appropriate for your data, because you tested the same fish in both situations."
396,4_logic,4_specific,What do you think is happening biologically to cause this?
397,1_basic,3_general,"There are a lot of good things in this report, but you didn’t make half the edits I suggested and still failed a basic criteria and had several technical flaws. If you are having trouble viewing my suggested edits, please let me know!"

399,4_logic,3_general,"Need to talk less about sources of error, and more about biological mechanisms"
400,4_logic,4_specific,This is not the same hypothesis you reported in the intro
401,3_technical,2_copyedit,Where is your reference to Figure 1?
402,3_technical,2_copyedit,remove (Statistics details)
403,3_technical,2_copyedit,This actually means your results are not significant
404,3_technical,4_specific,At room temperature
405,3_technical,4_specific,This is good but needs the appropriate error bars (the s.d. for the exp. and control will probably not be the same value. You will calculate the s.d.’s and then input them in as “custom” error bars).Also figures don’t need titles.
406,3_technical,4_specific,"It would be better to show the results, even when they’re not significant"
407,3_technical,4_specific,Citation?
408,2_writing,2_copyedit,Capitalize P

411,3_technical,2_copyedit,This should only have the first author
412,4_logic,4_specific,Don’t end on a citation from another study. Include one or more sentences about why this research is important from your own perspective.
413,3_technical,2_copyedit,This should say “Figure 1:  Average change in …”
414,3_technical,2_copyedit,What percentage and how much?
415,2_writing,4_specific,Hypothesis in the Abstract
416,4_logic,6_holistic,Are you sure about this?
417,3_technical,4_specific,This is contradictory! When was longer before or after the drug application? It cannot be longer in both
418,3_technical,4_specific,These lines require (custom) standard deviation error bars.
419,3_technical,2_copyedit,But your values are reported in centimeters
420,3_technical,4_specific,Put this at the end of the methods.
421,2_writing,4_specific,Use your introduction to explain the biology of your experiment and treatment. Save descriptions of specific behaviors for the methods section.
422,4_logic,2_copyedit,this is probably unnecessary (rationale in introduction)
423,3_technical,4_specific,"Your regression analysis is fine. Use the regression template on Sakai. The p value is the probability that the line is flat. If p &gt; 0.05, then that means the line is not horizontal, which means that there is an effect of size"

430,3_technical,2_copyedit,Should be 0.1 ml of 1 mM tubocurarine
431,4_logic,3_general,This one should be backed up with your data result
432,2_writing,4_specific,I think here explaining what a phosphodiesterase is/does would be helpful.
433,3_technical,2_copyedit,Spectrometer
434,2_writing,4_specific,I would make the title say “Effect of *chemical* on *muscle* *species*”
435,3_technical,4_specific,"as long as you state your full statistical results in your results section, you do not need this figure"
436,4_logic,6_holistic,Consider this possibility: What if your enriched chloroplasts did not actually have high chloroplasts in them? Recall that you didn’t examine through the microscope to measure the relative density of chloroplasts in your samples. You picked B pellet because it “should” have enriched chloroplasts given you isolated the chloroplasts properly. You could add it in your discussion as well.
437,4_logic,4_specific,Wouldn’t the threshold then be higher? Which would support your hypothesis?
438,3_technical,4_specific,How so? In which processes are light energy involved? Be specific.
439,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly).

448,3_technical,2_copyedit,Glycine isn’t a sugar.
449,4_logic,4_specific,"To understand this properly, a reader needs to know why the R:S ratio is important, which requires some understanding of resource allocation. You have made great improvements to the intro, but it still needs some information on resource allocation/phenotypic plasticity, to give context for why you measured R:S ratios instead of some other variable on the plant."
450,3_technical,4_specific,Try to be a little more specific about your y-axis
451,3_technical,3_general,DOI’s do not belong in your citations

459,3_technical,4_specific,So did you exclude it?
460,2_writing,1_pointer,?
461,2_writing,4_specific,"You can say this different. Once the threshold was determined, 3 myograms were recorded for each gastrocnemius muscle and the amplitude of contraction was measured."
462,2_writing,3_general,"Something to think about—I’d organize this a bit differently. So, you discuss 4 ways in which cells receive signals—why not connect this to which of the 4 ways Physarum can receive signals?"

472,4_logic,4_specific,This would have to take into account physiological needs of the Physarum.
473,3_technical,4_specific,I’d also add something about checking growth after the 72 hour and calculating growth rate mark based on that study.
474,3_technical,4_specific,Citation?
475,3_technical,3_general,No tables!
476,3_technical,2_copyedit,units
477,3_technical,3_general,I see what you meant in lab about the figure and everything being incorrect. If you need additional help fixing it let me know and we can meet.

479,3_technical,4_specific,"Because these bars are averages, each bar needs standard deviations"
480,3_technical,2_copyedit,You need to write the citation for this experiment
481,3_technical,4_specific,"These look like figure captions, not a results section. Here, just state that xxx was not significantly different than yyy. Give the actual p values in the text, and refer to the figures. No need for the tables with the p values"
482,3_technical,4_specific,"Finally, those standard deviations for each group look to be the same, which shouldn’t be the case. Make sure you’re setting each bar to have it’s own standard deviation"
483,3_technical,4_specific,These hormones also regulate the molting form one larva instar to the next one.
484,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is improper citation format. Refer to the resource guide.
485,2_writing,6_holistic,"Normally, you want to avoid direct quotations in your report and simply paraphrase anything over 2-3 words long. However, since this is a statement of a specific principle, you may leave it in as is if there is no good way to paraphrase it."
486,4_logic,6_holistic,"True, but you should also try to provide an explanation for what you saw. Why might the addition of phosphorous act in this manner?"
487,2_writing,4_specific,You need to start much more broadly. Explain resource allocation and its importance.
488,3_technical,4_specific,You said no SD in your results. You also said a totally different distance in your results.
489,3_technical,2_copyedit,2018?
490,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You mention three different chemicals in these two sentences. Pretty sure you guys did the nicotinic acetylcholine antagonist, also called tubocurarine."
491,2_writing,4_specific,Give some indication of the results here
492,2_writing,4_specific,start it as a new sentence
493,3_technical,2_copyedit,Is this a citation for the lecture? It’s not the correct citation for the lab manual.
494,2_writing,3_general,condense and focus
495,3_technical,4_specific,Refer to figure again.Report the results of your ANOVA properly (see resource guide) – need the p-value in the results section.
496,3_technical,4_specific,"Rather than saying their study had better results, I would focus on whether they had similar results/conclusions as your study."
497,3_technical,4_specific,"The error bars seem to have been done with the default function Excel provides as they aren’t centered on the points. If you need help with the standard deviation bars, email me so that we can meet or see the resource guide under “displaying data.”"

502,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Once again, not super relevant. You can just start with the insects"
503,3_technical,4_specific,"So I would change the x-axis so that your legend is the label instead of the number 1. Also, for your y-axis, have it say “Twitch Threshold (V)”"

505,2_writing,4_specific,"No need to explain here, put this in the discussion if you think you need it."

509,3_technical,4_specific,"Why two-tailed? Seriously, let me know and/or come to me for help."
510,2_writing,4_specific,This is okay here but should really be in the methods
511,2_writing,2_copyedit,Intensity or frequency? Be specific
512,3_technical,4_specific,"These figures need work.  Making all of the treatment red and all of the control blue would be a good way to fix this, but more would still nee to be done."
513,3_technical,4_specific,Only 2 bars are needed. Control vs Treatment.
514,4_logic,4_specific,Need to define this behavior

516,2_writing,3_general,This is a poor first sentence.  Find a better way to bring the reader into your paper.
517,3_technical,4_specific,"I think your first table is showing the average of the three frog legs, not the average for each leg. If you have figure 1, you can omit this table. They are showing the same information.That could be the figure caption"
518,3_technical,4_specific,You also should not represent the same data in a figure and a table. These p-values are also different from the ones you reported in your lab report.
519,3_technical,3_general,Citation formattingYou need at least another source
520,2_writing,3_general,informal
521,3_technical,3_general,This figure caption does not have enough information in it.
522,3_technical,2_copyedit,…hornworm?
523,4_logic,4_specific,Don’t say this. You had a reason for thinking it and you backed it up. Why did you get a different result than you thought?
524,3_technical,2_copyedit,In-text citation formatting

527,3_technical,2_copyedit,Refer to figures. Include your t-test results to justify.
528,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly). As such, this graph would need 12 standard deviation bars total."
529,4_logic,3_general,No need to discuss sources of error or anecdotes unless you have evidence that it actually affected your results
530,3_technical,2_copyedit,"However, one-way ANOVA did not show any statistically significant difference.."
531,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?
532,3_technical,2_copyedit,~400µL
533,3_technical,2_copyedit,"In addition, any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly)"
534,2_writing,2_copyedit,Metamorphical?
535,4_logic,3_general,Why? Tie this to your biological background info.
536,3_technical,4_specific,Don’t get too in detail describing significance but you can say that the results are significant and leave it at that.
537,3_technical,3_general,You should explain this (in the discussion).  Especially the 95% confidence part
538,3_technical,4_specific,This is part of the results because those were direct observations from the experiment
539,3_technical,4_specific,You never mentioned the species in your lab report. Hat is important
540,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format..use square brackets
541,3_technical,4_specific,"Table 1, 2, and 3 are considered raw data (basic criteria) and should be removed. The graph above is enough."
542,3_technical,2_copyedit,Statistic is not a measurement of accuracy
543,3_technical,4_specific,Which shows what? +/-1 standard deviation? Something else?
544,3_technical,4_specific,"Where is the caption for your table? Also, what do your error bars represent? This is not a detailed enough caption for the graph figure."
545,2_writing,4_specific,This is what an analogue is. You can leave it as “a juvenile hormone analogue”
546,3_technical,4_specific,"This should be mentioned also in the results, not here by first time."
547,3_technical,3_general,"For your list of Literature Cited, use the citation styles as indicated in the manual."
548,3_technical,4_specific,Why did you plot linearity with pH 0 but not 6? Please include time 0 data points.
549,3_technical,4_specific,You need captions. You also need error bars
550,4_logic,3_general,I would try to see if there were any past studies that may support this idea.
551,3_technical,3_general,Citations should include the yearSee resource guide
552,4_logic,4_specific,"You should explain this in the context of limiting reactants. If phosphorous is abundant, the plant allocates energy to collecting less abundant nutrients to ensure efficient photosynthesis. This is a more scientific way of explaining the observed phenomenon."
553,3_technical,6_holistic,"According to this, JH profile will present peaks of secretion just before each molting. Is that in correspondence with the information in your lab manual and the lectures? Remember that both hormones (ecdysone and JH) do not have the same pattern of secretion."
554,3_technical,2_copyedit,"The same leg was the control and treatment condition, so write this in correspondence to that. You can just focus on the effect before and after injection."
555,3_technical,4_specific,This figure could be improved by either color-coding individual legs or control vs. experimental groups to give some basis for comparison.
556,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
557,3_technical,4_specific,Which t-test did you use?
558,3_technical,4_specific,Did you reference this figure in your methods? If you have it here it should be somewhere in your methods section
559,3_technical,4_specific,This is raw data – please do not include. A table or figure showing the summarized data is all you need.
560,3_technical,2_copyedit,maybe partially supported?
561,1_basic,3_general,Your discussion would have been strong had you used actual primary literature.
562,2_writing,3_general,Don’t copy/paste from your abstract.
563,3_technical,4_specific,"Several things: your graphs and tables represent the same thing, so I would just have the graphs and get rid of the tables."
564,3_technical,4_specific,"Not true, those were stimulation electrodes, to stimulate the sciatic nerve, and consequently stimulate the gastrocnemius muscle.The contractions were recorded with the force transducer connected to the gastrocnemius muscle"
565,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Good, but reference your figures in this section"
566,4_logic,3_general,Some problems with interpretation here
567,4_logic,4_specific,"This needs more biological support. I know we talked about this in OH as being fuzzy, but I’m looking for you to give some indication about why the article you cited claims positive charge could be an attractant."
568,3_technical,2_copyedit,Write [Johnson : 2018]
569,4_logic,3_general,This is also an interpretation
570,3_technical,4_specific,"This is descriptive statistics, so you can have this value without running a t-test."
571,3_technical,2_copyedit,One-way ANOVA
572,3_technical,4_specific,I would recommend you explain how are the proportions of these two hormones before pupation. That will help the reader to understand the hypothesis better.
573,2_writing,1_pointer,known
574,2_writing,3_general,Be more specific
575,4_logic,6_holistic,"Good support, but you need to more specifically connect this citation to your study. Why would you expect bettas to behave differently in the presence of food given this information?"
576,3_technical,2_copyedit,Should have mentioned about Tukey-Kramer Test [didn’t follow-up]
577,3_technical,4_specific,"So, the different tails matter. Find out what they mean and pick one (the appropriate one) to use as your p-value"
578,3_technical,2_copyedit,Mention your critical value for p to determine significance
579,4_logic,6_holistic,You need to connect the dots for your reader. How does a dominance hierarchy connect to food availability?
580,2_writing,4_specific,You didn’t mention the hypothesis in the Abstract. That is necessary
581,3_technical,3_general,"While this form of citation isn’t inherently wrong, we try to use (Last name, Year of publication) within 114."
582,3_technical,4_specific,"While I do understand that a lot of your observations seem to be pointing in one direction, I would avoid saying that these observations alone are enough to conclude or something you can assume from. I would definitely still talk about it in the discussion and emphasize that this “may” be the case rather than saying it definitively is. There’s also the possibility that Precor has another ingredient that somehow sped up pupal eclosion which would account for less movement, faded color, and being less “plump.” Overall, they’re definitely things you can talk about but not something you can be completely sure about."
583,4_logic,6_holistic,"Are predatory responses the same as aggressive responses? If so, you need to explain the connection."
584,2_writing,2_copyedit,Take this out.
585,2_writing,3_general,I wouldn’t start the Intro like this and I would not state that like the main reason for using Manduca sexta.
586,4_logic,4_specific,Why might they be different? Why would a different amount yield different reactions?
587,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure to include the statistical test used as well.
588,4_logic,6_holistic,"In what way, why? Which resources might be lacking in a sandy environment versus a soil one?"
589,3_technical,4_specific,Incorrect stats here. You should use the regression template on Sakai.
590,2_writing,3_general,revise
591,4_logic,4_specific,So what does this mean? Does this line up with your thoughts or not? Why do you think blocking calcium will lead to the response you propose?
592,2_writing,3_general,Your hypothesis should come last in your intro
593,3_technical,3_general,See my comments on your first submission about the graphs
594,4_logic,3_general,"Ok, so what does this mean? Relate it back to muscle physiology and your own experiment"
595,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
596,3_technical,3_general,"Just include figures with data or high quality in the lab report. You can omit this figure. Instead, you can explain this information with words."
597,3_technical,2_copyedit,… for muscle control. Be clear
598,2_writing,4_specific,This is the concept you need to elaborate on in your introduction.
599,4_logic,3_general,"Increasing sample size is always good, for all experiments. Focus on your other ideas for future directions, like other plants or other colors of light"
600,2_writing,6_holistic,But why should I keep reading?!
601,1_basic,4_specific,"As I said in my comments on your previous submission (and in class, and in the resource guide), DO NOT talk about the hypothesis in the Results. It will cause the report to fail (and this is otherwise a very good report). If you are confused, please come set up a time to meet with me and go over this."
602,2_writing,4_specific,This information should be included also in the results.
603,2_writing,2_copyedit,Electro-chemical gradient
604,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Just say no significant difference (t = , df = , p = )."
605,3_technical,4_specific,"This section needs a lot more detail. I should be able to know exactly what you did, down to the volumes of each reagent used, the contents of each reagent (for example grinding buffer), and the time/rpm/temp at which centrifuging occurred. Come talk to me if you are still confused as to what should be included and what shouldn’t."
606,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format is [last name : year]
607,4_logic,3_general,What background info led you to your experimental question?
608,3_technical,4_specific,How many replicates? How many tails did your t-test have? Why only weight and not length as well? Include both ratios.
609,2_writing,4_specific,Revise to make formal
610,3_technical,4_specific,"I don’t see them? Also, why change graphs? I actually liked your graph in the first draft, and this new one is missing error bars (necessary if there are averages involved) and does not appear to have a caption."
611,3_technical,2_copyedit,Its just a paired t-test
612,4_logic,4_specific,"I asked you to revise this to a more specific hypothesis statement. Reading this, I lack connection between the known effect of trifluoroperazine and what you expect to happen specifically."
613,3_technical,2_copyedit,27C
614,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Ecdysone is also called 20E, so these are the same thing"

616,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (Basic Criteria)
617,3_technical,4_specific,"Caterpillars aren’t actually numbered, although the x-axis implies that they are"
618,2_writing,2_copyedit,Reword!
619,3_technical,4_specific,This is a methods section. It cannot contain hypothesis. Be careful not to add useless details. Examples of TOO much detail are “…I used a paint brush to place a red dot on each grasshopper…” or “...we graphed our data...”
620,2_writing,3_general,revise
621,2_writing,4_specific,"You should not go into specifics, just mention that bettas show a wide range of aggressive behavior. You should describe the specific behaviors in the methods"

626,3_technical,4_specific,Support this with values Mean ± SD and the figure.
627,3_technical,4_specific,No need for the tables with the p values. Just give those values in the text of results section
628,2_writing,4_specific,"The details of the used equipment and software are not necessary in the Abstract. That is required in the methods. Rewrite this sentence without mentioning that, just summarizing the main idea of the experiment."
629,2_writing,3_general,No need for quotations
630,4_logic,4_specific,You spend almost no time discussing this or providing examples of past soruces
631,3_technical,4_specific,How did you calculate R:S? What statistical test did you perform? These are pieces of information you need to include.
632,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not the manual we are using.
633,3_technical,4_specific,Make it clear that you suspended the leg from a force transducer (this is how you actually measured the muscle twitch stimulated by the probes)
634,4_logic,2_copyedit,Omit comments like this one because if your results do not support the hypothesis you can still give a biological explanation.
635,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Your p-value shouldn’t have a standard deviation, not sure where this is coming from"
636,2_writing,3_general,You shouldn’t use citations or specific values in your abstract
637,2_writing,4_specific,Also this should be written in paragraph form.
638,3_technical,2_copyedit,“4-5 medium sized spinach leaves”
639,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence is a bit unclear
640,4_logic,3_general,I needed you to state whether or not your hypothesis was supported in your discussion.
641,3_technical,4_specific,For which data? The threshold or the contraction amplitude
642,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Maybe you could coalesce these? We predicted movement in both cohorts, but greater movement in the…"

657,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Just say “our hypothesis was”, otherwise it seems like you started the experiment and then formed a hypothesis"
658,3_technical,4_specific,What groups were compared?
659,2_writing,4_specific,Somewhere you should mention that this is called the threshold
660,2_writing,4_specific,Save this for the methods.
661,3_technical,4_specific,Did you include this in your data or do a Q-test?
662,2_writing,4_specific,"This belongs in your methods, not your intro."

666,3_technical,3_general,Use primary sources
667,4_logic,6_holistic,"Any chance that some of this error is due to observer error? If it was hard for the fish to see through the tank, was it also harder for you to see through it? So for the rest of the discussion you are interpreting the results you WISH you got, but I also need you to interpret the results that you DID get. What’s a biological explanation for the fact that you didn’t find a significant difference between your treatment groups?"
668,3_technical,4_specific,At ten minute intervals over a period of thirty minutes.
669,1_basic,4_specific,This is interpretation; it does not belong in the results.
670,3_technical,4_specific,This isn’t clear just yet as you didn’t tell me what you used for “control” data yet.
671,3_technical,4_specific,What about green? Did you have a control?
672,4_logic,4_specific,I’m not sure how you reached this conclusion.
673,2_writing,4_specific,I would try to include a sentence of 2 discussing the normal role of sodium in muscle contraction.
674,3_technical,2_copyedit,Not a peer reviewed/primary source
675,2_writing,4_specific,"The overwhelming majority of this information should go in the results section. In the discussion, you should just interpret the results and draw inference about your hypothesis, then compare to other studies and discuss biological mechanisms"
676,2_writing,2_copyedit,You already mentioned this. Avoid repeating information
677,2_writing,3_general,"Hypotheses are never correct or incorrect. Rather, your data do or don’t support the hypothesis"
678,3_technical,4_specific,"Those error bars look much better, nice job! Quick thing though, your y-axis label should have units on it"
679,3_technical,4_specific,More information about the stimulus is needed. What was the width of the pulses and how many pulses were used at each voltage?
680,2_writing,3_general,Just start by saying whether your hypothesis was supported; you don’t need to repeat your hypothesis and its rationale. This is redundant information.
681,4_logic,3_general,"In general, your discussion contains a lot of reasons why your data might have been wrong, but no biological interpretation of what you found in your experiment. Interpret your results first, then talk about the possible errors in the data."
682,3_technical,2_copyedit,No need to include the null hypothesis here
683,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should not include the tables from stat testing
684,2_writing,2_copyedit,I would avoid this word unless a statistical test was done to show that this average amplitude was statistically higher.
685,4_logic,4_specific,"You established that the change in length and mass were significantly different (Probably not due to random chance). However, this doesn’t say anything about pupation as it may be the case that the act of pupation uses up some of the stored energy and makes them more compact (Might not necessarily be true, but it’s an example)"
686,3_technical,4_specific,You are not showing statistical result I the figure.
687,2_writing,3_general,Your methods should be in past tense.
688,2_writing,2_copyedit,Figures 1 and 2

690,3_technical,2_copyedit,You still didn’t include the blocker’s name
691,4_logic,3_general,"Reduced, and reduced by what specifically? This is what I meant when I said include more biological background that is directly pertinent to what you need to explain experiment-wise."
692,3_technical,6_holistic,This is why we combine the data for all legs and focus on treatment vs controls and not comparing individual legs (they are replicates).
693,1_basic,3_general,Outside source missing (basic criteria)
694,4_logic,2_copyedit,Include a sentence about why this happened and use that to segue into why you should adapt your experiment.
695,3_technical,4_specific,What was the main obtained result? You could briefly mention that here.
696,3_technical,4_specific,"Don’t use a title on a figure, and revisit what should go into a figure caption because you’re missing a few things. Also your error bars seem to be wrong"
697,4_logic,3_general,"Use your primary resources to support what you’re saying, don’t just throw something in there."
698,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is saying the same than the 11st sentence. Do not repeat information
699,4_logic,3_general,This seems like it was just added in for the sake of having a source in the discussion. I would probably try to find another source that may fit better in your discussion such as a past study which you can compare your results with and to guide why you think your future study idea would work.
700,2_writing,4_specific,Consider the order of the sentences. It would be helpful to know this before mentioning the hypothesis.
701,2_writing,2_copyedit,(I think this flows better here.)

703,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars. As such, this graph should have 14 standard deviation bars in total."
704,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would include averages +/- your standard deviations
705,3_technical,2_copyedit,Using what test?
706,3_technical,4_specific,This is an observation
707,3_technical,2_copyedit,Roughly 40µL
708,2_writing,3_general,Start more broadly
709,3_technical,3_general,"Where are your citations? Your discussion needs to connect your findings to other scientific literature and use primary literature citations, just like your intro."
710,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I would not put it this way. You can rather say that, although our experiment showed statistically insignificant result, a previous study…”"
711,3_technical,4_specific,T-test gives a binary solution. It either significant or not significant. No intermediate.
712,3_technical,4_specific,You don’t need this table if you have the graph
713,2_writing,3_general,"The abstract is usually done after the experiment. As such, bits from the methods should still be in past tense and parts from the results and discussion should not be in future tense."

852,3_technical,4_specific,Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.
853,3_technical,4_specific,"What were those amplitudes? You did this for both conditions, but you are describing it like if you only did it after injection"

Suggestion: You could open your section by saying that “The slurry/ground mixture of chickweed was centrifuged using (name of the machine we used to centrifuge) at XG, Xrmp, at Xdegrees for Xmins to extract/isolate the chloroplasts. Any debris was removed and the solution was centrifuged again (mention specifications). The pellet was isolated and treated with Hill reaction assay (Table# provided in the supplement) to quantify photosynthesis activity. The absorbances were recorded…”"

868,4_logic,4_specific,It means your hypothesis is rejected and you fail to reject the null hypothesis
869,2_writing,6_holistic,This is a bit too much information on a previous experiment in an abstract. What I was trying to get at with my comment on this submission was that you can’t assume any reader would know what a phototactic control was.

887,2_writing,3_general,never use quotes
888,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report means as mean +/- sd. You need
889,3_technical,4_specific,Make it clear that each frog was its own control. This makes it sound like you used different frogs for the control and experimental treatments
890,4_logic,4_specific,Why? Why did you think this originally?

906,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the molarity and name of the inhibitor
907,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment

909,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much did you add? At what concentration?
910,3_technical,3_general,These captions need more.
911,2_writing,2_copyedit,After 30 min?

924,3_technical,4_specific,"You seemed to have found the standard deviation between the 3 different stimulus voltages rather than among the amplitudes you averaged to receive your value at each stimulus voltages. (Ex. I think you found the standard deviation between 0.061, 0.093, and 0.22 in table 2 rather than finding the standard deviation among the 4 readings you averaged to get 0.061. and the 4 readings averaged to get 0.093. and the 4 readings averaged to get 0.22)"
925,3_technical,4_specific,"Naturally, based on the way the ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer are calculated, if one does not show significant differences than the other also will not. It’s still good to include a mention of the Tukey-Kramer here and in the methods, though."
926,3_technical,3_general,Check the title of your x-axis. Maybe there is a better title
927,3_technical,4_specific,Give this number in the results section too
928,3_technical,4_specific,mention that picked three streams from each replicate with three readings and took avg values to conduct stat analysis

930,4_logic,4_specific,This does make sense since Ach affects the receptors and not the release itself of Ach (The Ach should still get released into the synapse. There’s just no receptors for the Ach to bind to afterwards).

934,3_technical,4_specific,"Since this is small you can report this as p &lt; 0.01, and remember like we talked about in class, this means it is significant"
935,4_logic,4_specific,I would relate this sentence more to the study you did. i.e. these results also imply a decrease in gastrocnemius muscle activity with the administration of tubocurarine

937,2_writing,4_specific,Be sure to proofread before submitting for small mistakes like these throughout your report

For example, all the procedure to isolate 200 ul into microtubes with labels A, B, B pellet, and C can be condensed in a single line stating that the sample containing the pellet after second centrifuge was used. Because if you followed the protocol properly to isolate the chloroplast, you should have the highest chloroplast in your B pellet sample.At the end of your Methods section, indicate what kind of statistical test you perform to analyze your data.

1207,3_technical,8_nobasis,Results!!

1211,2_writing,3_general,Revise this statement to make it clearer.
1212,4_logic,4_specific,How so? You need to be specific about how plant allocation increases fitness. (Introduction)

1230,3_technical,2_copyedit,Increase or reduce? Be specific!
1231,2_writing,3_general,"This abstract has a bit too much methods, and also talks about metamorphosis, which is not something you looked at in your experiment.

1265,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Supports, not proves"

Let me know if you need help with this when doing figures for your presentation"
1267,4_logic,3_general,"You can still include trends you see, but be sure to make it clear that this is only a trend that you’re seeing and not something you can be confident in stating given the data you have. Having an insignificant p-value means that your treatment groups are not different from one another – that the difference you are seeing is from chance, not because there was an effect from your treatment."

1280,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I know I said to be more specific, but this is too detailed. A nice title would be something along the lines of “Excess soil nutrients decrease root-shoot ratio of mung beans (Vigna radiata)”"

1292,3_technical,3_general,"Although we do want to show significant differences usually, it’s an unspoken rule that you don’t just state “We are going after significance” as that shouldn’t be the goal of science."
1293,3_technical,3_general,"Use consistent citation format. Preferred is (Author last name, Year)"
1294,3_technical,2_copyedit,Add your p-value in here somewhere
1295,2_writing,7_idiomatic,This info could actually go in supplement
1296,2_writing,4_specific,This decrease I think? The beginning of the sentence says decrease

1306,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would just write change in mass
1307,3_technical,2_copyedit,No need to include t-value or degrees of freedom (unless you intend to talk about them).
1308,3_technical,2_copyedit,Are these averaged values? Where are the SD
1309,3_technical,3_general,You report different p-values throughout the paper and have data in your figures that is not reflective of your p-values and is not different that the means and standard deviations that you report.
1310,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
1311,2_writing,4_specific,"Remember, keep methods out of the introduction"
1312,4_logic,4_specific,So you think that the soil types influence nutrient availability? That should be spelled out explicitly in your introduction.
1313,3_technical,2_copyedit,Vermiculite
1314,3_technical,2_copyedit,p-value needs to be here to back this claim up
1315,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats results?
1316,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I don’t think the error bars on this graph are correct, as they look pretty similar for both control and treatment groups"
1317,3_technical,4_specific,What results? The statistic outcome per se it is not the result. You should state ere the direct observation. Statistics is just a tool to corroborate that those difference were caused by the treatment.
1318,3_technical,2_copyedit,What are the standard deviations for those averages?
1319,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Your figure does not need a title, what goes in the “title” should be in a figure caption."

1323,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
1324,3_technical,4_specific,…what is going on with this graph? Where’s the y-axis? Why do the numbers have so many digits? Why are the bars the same for both groups?
1325,2_writing,4_specific,Give some indication of the results here. Does/does not affect…
1326,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical analysis did you do?

1337,2_writing,2_copyedit,Ecdysterone?
1338,3_technical,4_specific,"This doesn’t apply to your original hypothesis because size and pupation are not perfectly linked.  So this p value simply says that your data is not random, and something was different between the control and exp but it doesn’t mean anything more than that."
1339,3_technical,2_copyedit,Was this an ANOVA?
1340,3_technical,3_general,Authors transfer from place to place and eventually they die. Their affiliations cannot be cited.

1382,3_technical,4_specific,"Its not that the pulse doesn’t occur. The bump of ecdysone still happens, it just doesn’t meet the specific criteria (i.e. JH being low at the same time as the pulse) to move on into pupation. Thus the caterpillar isn’t ready hormonally for the commitment pulse and basically misses its chance to pupate."
1383,3_technical,4_specific,This should only be in your methods section. You can write that the weights will be measured but that’s it
1384,3_technical,3_general,Cite your sources correctly.
1385,2_writing,8_nobasis,What does this mean?

1393,2_writing,4_specific,I would make this two sentences so it’s a little clearer that the last part is your hypothesis
1394,3_technical,2_copyedit,These numbers should also have units

1461,2_writing,4_specific,Better! Just note for next time that this is typically something that goes in an intro
1462,4_logic,4_specific,This can be left out as data keeping methods isn’t crucial to repeating the experiment and will not necessarily affect the experiment’s outcome.

1467,3_technical,2_copyedit,Also include tstat and df
1468,3_technical,4_specific,Did you have a control group?

If so, you should know that the error bars in Sheets are not correct (Google can’t handle the necessary stats). If you want help on how to do them in Excel, please let me know.

1491,3_technical,4_specific,"Amps (Amperes) is a unit of current.  In the Ohm’s law V = I * R, Amperes is the I, Ohms is the R and Volts is the V.  This confusion came from the Amplitude box on the Lab scribe software, which means what is the amplitude (or height of the wave form) that the function generator is making.  This means how big is the amplitude of the voltage you are applying to the frog leg."
1492,3_technical,2_copyedit,What chemical are you using?

1495,3_technical,3_general,"I would suggest numbering steps or (preferably), turning this into a paragraph, not a bulleted list."
1496,3_technical,4_specific,Can you specify which is your experimental condition? You could say that there was a larger threshold for contraction after the injection of lidocaine
1497,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not right. The muscle was connected to a force transducer and that measured the contraction.
1498,3_technical,3_general,These are raw data and should not be included
1499,4_logic,3_general,How does this relate to your results? You need to connect the dots for your readers

1505,2_writing,4_specific,"Supporting info for your prediction should be in the intro, while supporting info for your outcomes/results goes in the discussion. If these are the same thing, just think about how you frame this evidence."
1506,3_technical,6_holistic,Do you see evidence for this in the size data?
1507,2_writing,3_general,Briefly describe your experiment.
1508,3_technical,3_general,Where are the table legends? That is necessaryYou are missing the SD for those averages.
1509,2_writing,4_specific,Can you be more specific? Include the studied physiological process in the title.
1510,2_writing,3_general,"Do not quote other papers, explain their results with your own words."
1511,3_technical,4_specific,So the entire circumference of the plate?
1512,3_technical,4_specific,"This doesn’t accurately represent what you did, this reads as though you only did one trial for each treatment. Describe why you chose the particular types of fake fish that you did."
1513,3_technical,4_specific,For which condition? Shouldn’t you have more p-values?
1514,3_technical,4_specific,You need to label your axes. Include description of error bars and stats in your caption.
1515,3_technical,4_specific,"you can state this, but then also state that the decrease was not significant given your p-value (and then state the p-value)"
1516,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This is still methods, doesn’t need to be in a figure caption"
1517,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use?
1518,3_technical,6_holistic,Good point. The frequencies of each behavior might be worth graphing if you think it’s important for the discussion.
1519,4_logic,4_specific,Include somewhere in here which part of the photosynthetic process is affected by temperature and why it makes sense that changing temperature changes photosynthetic rate.
1520,3_technical,3_general,No mention of Figure 2? Make sure you refer in the text to all figures included at the end
1521,3_technical,4_specific,"What are these values? Are they averaged values? In that case, you should report mean ± SD"
1522,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I forgot to mention this, but what do your error bars represent? Put that here."
1523,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I would say “we predict”, otherwise it looks like you have two hypotheses with the one at the end of the paragraph"
1524,3_technical,4_specific,"Talk a bit about what, biologically, is going on in the muscle here"
1525,2_writing,2_copyedit,Remove

1528,3_technical,2_copyedit,At 27C
1529,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
1530,2_writing,4_specific,Consider mentioning the chemical name in the title
1531,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
1532,3_technical,4_specific,"The standard deviation bars seem to have been put through excel’s default standard deviation error bars (They don’t work properly). For help on how to put in the error bars properly, feel free to email me or refer to the resource guide for a guide on how to format these error bars."
1533,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure the axes titles are easy to see and be sure to clean up the picture a little by deleting “plot area”
1534,2_writing,1_pointer,Seems like you’re saying opposite things here.
1535,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
1536,4_logic,4_specific,"Give a little more explanation as to why this is your hypothesis. Tell me why alkaline pH could disrupt this light-dependent reactions. Otherwise, good intro too!"
1537,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Other results of your stats, df and t-stat"
1538,2_writing,4_specific,"If there were any trends observed, I would include a sentence or 2 about that as well (from your results)."
1539,2_writing,3_general,"I think you are explaining here the role of AchE, not the role of the blocker, so you should be consequent with that.You could explain first the function of AchE and then specify that you will use a blocker to study its role."
1540,2_writing,2_copyedit,Can you end on something broader? Why does this research matter to us? How might it be applied to problems in the real world?
1541,3_technical,4_specific,The two sample t-test should’ve been from data for both groups
1542,4_logic,1_pointer,?
1543,3_technical,4_specific,What structure should be repolarized? The membrane
1544,3_technical,2_copyedit,Mention your critical value for p to determine significance
1545,2_writing,3_general,Your explanation of plant allocation was not specific enough and you provided a lot of extraneous information.
1546,4_logic,4_specific,You need to better introduce your experimental treatment. Why might temperature change aggression level? You need to walk the reader through your thought process step by step.
1547,3_technical,2_copyedit,It should’ve been a two sample t-test
1548,3_technical,4_specific,It’s more a behavior exhibited by Physarum toward chemicals the elicit this behavior.
1549,3_technical,3_general,"Your results should include some actual numbers, such as averages +/- standard deviations"
1550,2_writing,6_holistic,"Here is a good place to talk about how you quantified the aggressive behaviors. You didn’t just observe the behaviors, you used the points system (which you explain well below, so you can work that part in up here instead of at the end of methods)."
1551,3_technical,4_specific,So some of this is accounted for in the experiment because you are running a paired t-test.
1552,3_technical,4_specific,You should refer the figures here in the text. Fr example mention (Figure 1) at the end of the sentence that describe the change in weight of the caterpillars.
1553,1_basic,4_specific,"Have to have references in the discussion section. Compare to other studies, to support why your data did or didn’t match your predictions"
1554,3_technical,4_specific,The specific labels are not as important as we can easily label them “X” and “Y” and get the same results.
1555,3_technical,4_specific,"You need to specify the statistical outcome here. This statement requires the p-value of the test as a supportAvoid using whole sentences just for the statistics. Combine the statistical outcome and the result. Remember the example that we analyzed in lab, last week."
1556,3_technical,4_specific,"You should have used a paired t-test. If this is what you used, say that. If not, what did you do?"
1557,3_technical,4_specific,Did you mean for each leg before and after the injection?
1558,3_technical,4_specific,Orient me here—where in the plant cell are we? (What reactions are we looking at specifically?)
1559,3_technical,4_specific,Where are your error bars? (and remember to put what they represent in the caption).
1560,3_technical,4_specific,Still need more references to back up this claim
1561,3_technical,4_specific,Where else do we see this pathway? So…why else is Physarum a great model organism for signaling studies?
1562,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data and shouldn’t be in your Report
1563,3_technical,2_copyedit,Chart not needed
1564,2_writing,4_specific,I would put this a little earlier in the intro right after you finish discussion muscle contractions
1565,3_technical,4_specific,"Some problems with interpretation of stats. Since the stats weren’t significant, you can’t say that “R:S was higher in the control…”. Just say that there was no difference between the two groups.     Need to give the p value in the text here"
1566,2_writing,4_specific,You don’t need so much here. Just a little taste of this would be enough.
1567,3_technical,2_copyedit,Mention your specific incubation period
1568,3_technical,4_specific,What does Precor mimic?
1569,4_logic,4_specific,You can also examine the previous traces against a light source to understand if your control group was indeed moved away from food. Should have discussed about the control group.
1570,3_technical,2_copyedit,"[Written: 1996], first author only"
1571,2_writing,3_general,Try to avoid using colloquial language. Look out for these throughout the report
1572,2_writing,1_pointer,Spelling mistake [didn’t follow up]
1573,3_technical,3_general,"You should refer people to your tables/figures when talking about the results they show (this section), not just later in the discussion."
1574,3_technical,2_copyedit,"For the next lab report, make sure your error bars are fitted to each data point; I can help with that!"
1575,4_logic,4_specific,Does this fact contradict your results? The use of “however” here seems out of place.
1576,3_technical,3_general,Avoid writing sentences for the statistical outcome only. Remember the example form last lab. Statistics should support the results.
1577,3_technical,2_copyedit,Are these averages? Where are your error bars?
1578,2_writing,3_general,Generally we don’t have citations in the abstract
1579,3_technical,2_copyedit,"For the same reason as above, I would only include the graph and label which bars represent which treatment."
1580,3_technical,4_specific,Missing error bars
1581,2_writing,4_specific,This looks like methods material.

1588,3_technical,3_general,Force and amplitude are different things
1589,4_logic,4_specific,"Why? Is this part of your hypothesis? If you want to test this, you should talk about variations in individual behavior (or something along those lines) in your intro, and make a prediction for what you will find in your hypothesis."
1590,3_technical,2_copyedit,Refer to figures. Include your t-test results to justify.
1591,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Be careful here. Even though the means were slightly different, the stats weren’t significant, so I would just say that the weight ratios were not different"
1592,3_technical,6_holistic,"Is this the purpose of the graph, to compare them easily?"
1593,2_writing,2_copyedit,No inconsistencies? Did you mean that there were inconsistencies?
1594,3_technical,4_specific,What stats test did you run?  Paired t-test
1595,3_technical,4_specific,Not informative or needed. Report p-value in results.

1605,3_technical,4_specific,"A one-tailed paired t-test is more appropriate here, please re-analyze the data."
1606,3_technical,4_specific,"Rany time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars. As such, this graph should have 14 standard deviation bars in total."
1607,3_technical,4_specific,Is this correct? I would think at the critical weight there would be less JH
1608,3_technical,4_specific,Why? Give me a little information about how Physarum uses actin and myosin for movement.
1609,3_technical,4_specific,"I don’t see a table? Regardless, it will be more useful for you to explain how you assigned points in words."
1610,3_technical,4_specific,"The “title” of this graph should actually be the y-axis label.

1700,4_logic,6_holistic,"I’m not sure that this directly follows from the previous sentence, or that it’s a useful citation.In general, you should work on improving this discussion: start with more background information, using more biological statements and citations to build your argument up until you introduce your hypothesis toward the end of the introduction. You shouldn’t include the title of articles in the in-text citation (you may in other fields, but not in scientific writing). I am interesting in hearing more about the murky water environment and why you think the fish will be less aggressive in it. Beyond just not being able to see, can you think of an evolutionary reason why they may be less aggressive than they are in the aquariums?"

1710,3_technical,4_specific,"This is the concentration of the hormone, so it should go in the methods section"
1711,1_basic,3_general,These are really methods and a serious breach of the basic criteria.

1728,3_technical,3_general,"These figures are raw data, which does not belong in a lab report"
1729,4_logic,3_general,You don’t have to be quite so exhaustive when describing other studies. You also need to connect the dots for your reader. What’s the takeaway?
1730,3_technical,3_general,Refer people to your figure(s) in the results.
1731,3_technical,4_specific,What specifically determines the allocation strategy of a given plant?

1784,3_technical,4_specific,Report this statistical outcome with the weight observations. Statistics should support your observations.

1800,2_writing,3_general,Avoid starting sentences with “because”
1801,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not needed as most people reading this will be able to assume the caterpillars were differentiable somehow.
1802,1_basic,3_general,You need to include primary literature in your discussion. It’s an automatic failing grade if you do not.
1803,3_technical,4_specific,What does this figure show? (I think your numbers are out of order). You probably don’t need a table of numbers like this unless you want to refer to specific values (more than a couple).

1911,3_technical,4_specific,What do the bars show? What are you attempting to relay with this figure?
1912,3_technical,2_copyedit,Need to state the averages and standard devs of the figure in this caption
1913,2_writing,4_specific,"This is an awkward transition. Typically, asking outright questions in a paper if you don’t immediately answer them is not the best approach."
1914,2_writing,2_copyedit,supported
1915,3_technical,3_general,You can continue to just “kale” instead since you’ve already identified it as the common name
1916,2_writing,4_specific,Even half a sentence on why this would happen would be good.
1917,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence is not super relevant
1918,2_writing,4_specific,This is kind of strange phrasing. Just say that seeds were grown.
1919,2_writing,4_specific,State the species and muscle you are working with
1920,2_writing,2_copyedit,not a scientific term
1921,3_technical,4_specific,"I would go ahead and include means +/- SDs in this section. Also, what are your other p-values? Typically, an ANOVA gives you one p-value for overall variance, and then you interrogate individual groups with the Tukey-Kramer, which, for your conditions, should give you more than one p-value."
1922,1_basic,4_specific,This is interpretation of results don’t state this here. State if the p-value is significant but do not make a comment on the hypotheses.
1923,3_technical,2_copyedit,Cite figure
1924,3_technical,2_copyedit,What is this ability called?
1925,2_writing,3_general,Good but can be shortened. Less methods and intro bits.
1926,3_technical,4_specific,Where is the repolarization occurring? You didn’t mention the repolarization in the muscle.
1927,3_technical,4_specific,"Once again, statistics are need to really confirm or reject a hypothesis"
1928,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is the same than before. Do not repeat information
1929,4_logic,4_specific,"Be more specific, it’s not that they both gained weight, but did you expect them to gain the same amount/rate"
1930,2_writing,3_general,Just make sure to read this section again and check for any redundancy
1931,2_writing,4_specific,"Is this a previous experiment? If so, what did they test and find?"
1932,3_technical,4_specific,"In the first big chunk of texts, you need some citations, as most of this stuff isn’t common knowledge. You also need to introduce the species you are working with, why it is helpful to study, and what muscle you are focusing on"
1933,2_writing,6_holistic,"Good job not interpreting in the results, but I would just leave this sentence out entirely. You don’t need to tell people that you’ll discuss this in the discussion since they will assumptively be reading it in a few moments."
1934,1_basic,4_specific,"This does NOT belong in the results. This is interpretation, which belongs in the discussion. Your results should simply state what happened (controls grew more), refer people to your figures which show this, and state the p-value (but NOT talk about what that means for the hypothesis)."
1935,3_technical,4_specific,Decrease in percent change doesn’t necessarily mean increase in absorbance.
1936,3_technical,2_copyedit,Just first author’s name is sufficient
1937,4_logic,6_holistic,Why would weight drop? How is JH tied to weight and what changes to it will caue changes in weight
1938,3_technical,2_copyedit,Sciatic nerve
1939,2_writing,6_holistic,"Omit this, experiments are not successful if you only obtain the expected results. Experiments are successful if everything works and you get data."
1940,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much did you inject?
1941,3_technical,2_copyedit,Mention the critical value for p to determine significance
1942,3_technical,4_specific,"These are two different cells, so the same action potential (AP) cannot be in both Those are 2 AP, so you are missing some steps in between."
1943,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Do not cite your results, you didn’t take this information from a previous experiment. That was an observation from your own experiment."
1944,3_technical,2_copyedit,Paired t-test
1945,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (basic criteria)
1946,3_technical,4_specific,Check that unit
1947,3_technical,6_holistic,This is not an explanation of the results. This is why we use that cut-off level in science to determine statistical significance. That is not necessary in the discussion of your lab report.
1948,3_technical,4_specific,Why you use kale?
1949,4_logic,3_general,What is the big picture? Why is studying this significant?
1950,2_writing,4_specific,"Avoid reporting p values in abstract, rather mention that it was statistically significant"
1951,4_logic,4_specific,"Why? What role does light spectrum play in photosynthesis? Find some literature and support your claims! Also, filters exclude all light except their color"
1952,3_technical,2_copyedit,Alpha?
1953,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not necessary
1954,1_basic,4_specific,"Where is your hypothesis? Also, where do you talk about why you chose this animal? I’m not even clear on what you are testing here."
1955,4_logic,6_holistic,You need to be more specific about how plants allocate resources in different environmental conditions. What are the general patterns? What might you expect in restricted light and why?
1956,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would include your means+/-SDs for each condition here.
1957,3_technical,4_specific,"According to statistics they are similar, not slightly different"
1958,3_technical,2_copyedit,Don’t cite a source twice with different numbers. The citation format I referenced above will help with this.
1959,3_technical,4_specific,"I know the resource guide asks you to state dependent/independent variables, but as long as what you are treating the caterpillars with is in there, the variables are implied and you don’t have to include a sentence like this if you don’t want to, especially in the intro."
1960,2_writing,3_general,revise
1961,3_technical,4_specific,What’d you do with the centrifuged solution? What was in the pellet?
1962,3_technical,2_copyedit,I don’t think the error bars here were formatted properly as all the control and all the experimentals seem to have the same the same error bar.
1963,3_technical,4_specific,Explain the commitment pulse
1964,3_technical,2_copyedit,Control animals
1965,4_logic,4_specific,Does this source describe this process? Did it test this process in something else?
1966,4_logic,6_holistic,Relate this back to a bigger picture. Why is it important that we understand the effect of temperature on photosynthetic rate?
1967,3_technical,4_specific,"Try to nix the table and put this into words. Also, I don’t think you added 10 mL seltzer water to 30 mL Hill reaction buffer."
1968,2_writing,6_holistic,Be careful with this wording—we don’t want to imply that Physarum has a nervous system.
1969,3_technical,4_specific,All these should be your results. That is written exactly like it should be in the results.
1970,2_writing,2_copyedit,Over a 30 minute period would be a better way to put it.
1971,4_logic,4_specific,How does what ecdysone does actually relate to the weight of the caterpillar?
1972,3_technical,8_nobasis,There was only one figure
1973,1_basic,3_general,Also include primary literature in your discussion.
1974,3_technical,2_copyedit,Two sample t-test
1975,4_logic,6_holistic,"It’s not really stopping production of sodium, revisit this idea"
1976,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Again, past-passive."
1977,2_writing,4_specific,"Avoid stating stat results in abstract. Alternatively, you can say that your herbicide did not significantly decrease photosynthesis which was supported by your t-test analysis."
1978,2_writing,3_general,"Need a little more detail in the abstract. Briefly explain your methods, and give your hypothesis"
1979,4_logic,4_specific,How do plants use phosphorous? Be specific.
1980,3_technical,4_specific,Needs citation
1981,4_logic,3_general,This is already implicit when you said that they were significant different.
1982,4_logic,3_general,What could you do next? Why does this matter in the broader context of science and nature?
1983,2_writing,3_general,revise
1984,4_logic,4_specific,"As you’re looking at the role of a potassium blocker, I would include what the role of potassium is in normal muscle contraction. From this, you can build out and say “and this is why we think our hypothesis.”"
1985,3_technical,4_specific,Which reasons? Be specific.
1986,3_technical,4_specific,"Your figures are interesting but do not display the data well.  When you separate the treatment from the control its impossible to compare them to see the difference that you talk about.The graph of weight change from the previous day is really cool but again, impossible to tell which group was the largest and by how much (this graph also needs standard deviation error bars because its displaying averages).   If you made a figure that showed average overall weight change from day one to day 8 (with error bars) this would be acceptable.  It should look like a bar graph with one bar being the treatment, and one bar being the control."
1987,3_technical,4_specific,This should be included in the results because those are direct observations of the experiment
1988,3_technical,3_general,"This all seems a little excessive, try to trim down your figure caption a little"
1989,3_technical,4_specific,"Because the same legs served as the experimental and control, I would recommend a paired t-test instead."
1990,2_writing,3_general,This is unclear
1991,2_writing,4_specific,Rewrite the entire title. It is confusing. Keep it simple and easy to understand by the reader. That’s the best!
1992,3_technical,3_general,You need to include a figure caption
1993,2_writing,2_copyedit,Unnecessary
1994,3_technical,2_copyedit,Paired t-test
1995,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use to analyze your data?
1996,3_technical,4_specific,You should only run one paired t-test on both leg’s data.
1997,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly)"
1998,3_technical,4_specific,You should not report the same information in figures and tables. Remove the data tables and keep the figure.
1999,2_writing,4_specific,"This should come later in the introduction. Introduce the general concept first; nerves and muscles, the organism, etc"
2000,3_technical,3_general,You should also reference your tables at the end of this section where you talk about relevant data from them.
2001,2_writing,4_specific,"Your introduction should also mention the species you are working on, and conclude with your hypothesis"
2002,3_technical,2_copyedit,Change in weight
2003,3_technical,4_specific,Which type of t-test?
2004,3_technical,4_specific,"Try to summarize your methods in a better way without putting too much detail. For example, all the procedure to isolate 200 ul into microtubes with labels A, B, B pellet, and C can be condensed in a single line stating that the sample containing the pellet after second centrifuge was used. Because if you followed the protocol properly to isolate the chloroplast, you should have the highest chloroplast in your B pellet sample."
2005,3_technical,2_copyedit,"mM is a unit for concentration (100mM = 100mmol/L). As such, the “/L” is not needed."
2006,2_writing,4_specific,Include highlights from Methods and Discussions
2007,2_writing,4_specific,Include the table contents in your methods section and delete the table. The table is for lab notebooks only
2008,3_technical,3_general,"Do not write the methods like instructions in a lab manual. Write the methods in past tense, explaining what did you do."
2009,4_logic,3_general,This is unnecessaryIn the discussion you just need to briefly mention the result again and give some possible interpretations and explanations to those observations.
2010,3_technical,4_specific,You might want to show more data in this figure. Showing leg 1 control and treatment and then leg 2 control and treatment rather than one control and treatment.
2011,3_technical,4_specific,Also the error bars are not placed correctly
2012,3_technical,4_specific,What is? (Model system question)
2013,3_technical,2_copyedit,Eight roughly…The numbers should be written like that at the beginning of the sentences.
2014,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report the mean ± SD. You should always report those values together.
2015,4_logic,6_holistic,Why was the aggressive behavior never observed in the presence of another betta?
2016,3_technical,4_specific,This is almost significant. Maybe using weight change would be more effective
2017,3_technical,4_specific,Why unequal? How many tails?
2018,4_logic,4_specific,"Just remember that they are pest during the larvae phase and according to your prediction, they will remain as a larva. However, I understand that affecting their transition to adulthood, they won’t be able to reproduce and consequently this can control the number of larvae."
2019,3_technical,4_specific,"Statistical null hypothesis. If you are going to say later that the data supports you main/alternative hypothesis, you need to make clear that you are only talking about the statistical result here."
2020,3_technical,3_general,This (but not everything in it) should be written in paragraph form in your results section.
2021,3_technical,4_specific,It would be nicer if you include this in the Results section
2022,3_technical,4_specific,"This is not clear, probably because you did not specify that you put 2 individuals in each container and that is why you separated them with a notecard."
2023,3_technical,2_copyedit,I think something is off with error bars
2024,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? You need to introduce the mechanism of aggression in order for your reader to understand your hypothesis.
2025,2_writing,3_general,Wrong tense
2026,3_technical,4_specific,Consider the y-axis: Amplitude of Contraction (V)
2027,4_logic,2_copyedit,Avoid discussing all the sources of error like habituation
2028,2_writing,3_general,explain why this would effect anything
2029,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check this amount
2030,3_technical,3_general,This and the lab manual are not primary sources and should not be used alone as your intro citations without a real citation from primary literature there as well.
2031,4_logic,6_holistic,Why might the fish be more aggressive? How does the quality of their habitat change with shelter?
2032,4_logic,4_specific,"Your hypothesis doesn’t seem like it was supported by your results. Your hypothesis was that the caffeine would increase the contraction of the muscles but your results show that caffeine nearly eliminated muscle response to stimulus. Remember that a statistical test shows if the difference in the control/experimentals were likely due to chance. The low p value you guys received would say that the difference between control and caffeine (in this case, the extreme decrease in contraction) was by likely not by chance."
2033,2_writing,3_general,informal
2034,3_technical,3_general,"Again, this is more detail than is needed in figures."
2035,3_technical,4_specific,This is not primary literature. Need to find some references about how color of opponents would affect aggression
2036,2_writing,3_general,pasttense
2037,3_technical,4_specific,Should have compared with recommended incubation time as indicated in lab manual. 3 hours seems very little compared to recommended time. Have you checked if their protocol is similar to ours?
2038,2_writing,4_specific,I don’t think most of this paragraph is really necessary – focus only on the results of the experiment that you did. You can refer to the studies that you cited in the intro for support.
2039,4_logic,4_specific,Still need some more info about why color would matter. Biological mechanisms about selection for color etc
2040,3_technical,4_specific,"Don’t need this figure, it is summed up nicely by the other one."
2041,3_technical,4_specific,"As long as you state these values in your results, you don’t need to have this table"
2042,3_technical,4_specific,"In the axon, most of the Ca++ entering the cell is extracellular. In the muscle, Ca++ ions come from the sarcoplasmic reticulum"
2043,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the values you measured and the standard deviations.  You could also reference your figure or graph
2044,3_technical,2_copyedit,it was the same leg in both conditions
2045,4_logic,6_holistic,"Instead of this long discussion of potential errors in your experiment, can you spend more time talking about the potential implications or applications of your study? Why do we need to know how crop plants respond to different soil types?"
2046,3_technical,2_copyedit,Frogs aren’t mammals
2047,2_writing,4_specific,You could actually get rid of this line. In abstract it is implied that you have both control and treatment groups.
2048,2_writing,3_general,See resource guide for a better abstract
2049,3_technical,3_general,This figure contains raw data. Only use summary data in your lab report.
2050,3_technical,4_specific,How long was each trial? What was the purpose of doing them with and without the glass partition? What was scored in the trials without the partitions? Which values do you use in your analysis? What statistical test did you use to analyze your data?
2051,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
2052,2_writing,3_general,Also add a concluding sentence
2053,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Fix this up, I think we talked about it"
2054,3_technical,2_copyedit,What is the p-value?
2055,2_writing,2_copyedit,I’m not sure this is the right term.
2056,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is not super relevant to your experiment so I don’t think it’s the greatest of concluding sentences
2057,3_technical,4_specific,You don’t need this because you didn’t analyze those variables. You only included the threshold in your results.So just focus on the threshold
2058,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the statistical test you used in your methods
2059,3_technical,2_copyedit,Three what – three plants? Three seeds? Three pots?
2060,2_writing,3_general,"I didn’t catch this the first time, (so you got lucky!) but always, always reference your figure in here somewhere."
2061,2_writing,4_specific,At the end of your discussion include possible implications of your experiment at a broader scale and include that highlight in abstract
2062,3_technical,3_general,This raw data and should not be included.
2063,2_writing,2_copyedit,Figure 2
2064,3_technical,4_specific,"They were not different specimens, they were the same before and after injection. Focus better on what you predicted it will happen after the injection."
2065,3_technical,4_specific,Also include your t-statistic and degrees of freedom
2066,3_technical,3_general,You can assume your reader has a basic knowledge of stats. Just say whether or not the results were significant and give the p-values.
2067,3_technical,2_copyedit,+/-SD
2068,4_logic,4_specific,"Well, this includes blue, right? I’m a little confused about your rationale with DCPIP because we’re talking about the chloroplasts’ abilities to absorb light. I would add more bio background, introduce DCPIP and why we used it"
2069,4_logic,4_specific,"Hmm, I don’t think the scale is the problem necessary, but you make a big assumption in that you assume betta reaction to fake fish accurately reflects their reactions to fish of different species. I don’t think you can assume that at all. Instead, think about why not reacting to fake objects in the tank might be a beneficial adaptation for these fish, and discuss the implications or potential evolutionary roots of that."
2070,2_writing,4_specific,This sentence is unnecessary. You can just start with the background on nerves.
2071,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Start with Authors last name, then year."
2072,2_writing,3_general,Your title should discuss what the experiment you did is actually about
2073,2_writing,3_general,Probably not necessary
2074,3_technical,2_copyedit,[Johnson: 2018]
2075,3_technical,4_specific,This needs a citaiton
2076,3_technical,4_specific,This is mainly me being picky but could you define what hindered would mean? (Less growth? Improper growth?)
2077,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to specify that you found the average of xxx number of plants per pot, then used the pot averages in statistics"
2078,3_technical,3_general,Cite this correctlySee the resource guide
2079,2_writing,3_general,"Give me full names first, then acronyms."
2080,2_writing,3_general,You need to start more broadly
2081,3_technical,4_specific,"While not technically raw data, this would be better shown in a graph, and you should have one of those in your report anyway, so I would suggest replacing this table with an appropriate figure. Please let me know if you have any questions."
2082,4_logic,4_specific,"While we can derive what this then means for the muscle with lidocaine, a hypothesis is generally written to discuss the expected result for the experimental treatment."
2083,3_technical,4_specific,How did you treat them (methods)?
2084,2_writing,4_specific,"You barely introduced the concept of resource allocation in your introduction (1 sentence). Remember, larger concepts need to be the focal point."
2085,2_writing,4_specific,"A lot of this discussion are statements that should be in the results.  From there, you would want to reference these statements and your figures and tell me what adding JH should do and how what you saw compares to that."
2086,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is repetitive.
2087,3_technical,2_copyedit,Refer to relevant table in parenthesis.
2088,2_writing,3_general,Hypotheses are neither correct nor incorrect
2089,3_technical,4_specific,Is this a citation?
2090,2_writing,6_holistic,"You pack a lot of biological concepts into this sentence but I am not sure it makes sense. Has evolution been shaped by selection, or do you really mean that animal behavior and appearances have been shaped by selection? What kind of selection has been at play with the bettas, specifically?"
2091,2_writing,4_specific,Make sure to include a brief sentence or two from your intro and methods (Briefly give background and talk about the big picture for your methods).
2092,2_writing,3_general,This doesn’t mean what I think you are trying to say
2093,3_technical,3_general,Don’t reference based on location in the text. Always refer to figures by number (and make sure all figures in the report are referenced in the results and/or discussion)
2094,2_writing,4_specific,See if you can rearrange this to put your hypothesis as the last sentence in the paragraph.
2095,4_logic,6_holistic,I need some biological background here on calcium signaling so I can understand why you hypothesize what you do. Why would Physarum even move toward calcium anyway?
2096,3_technical,2_copyedit,Significant?
2097,3_technical,3_general,"This would still be considered raw data. As for the statistical test portion, this does not need to be included. You only need to say which statistical test was used (In the methods) and what your p-value was (results/discussion)"
2098,3_technical,3_general,This is not what we agreed on summarizing these data.
2099,3_technical,2_copyedit,It’s just called a paired t-test. I know you wrote the two sample everywhere so just make sure you fix that
2100,1_basic,4_specific,"Don’t talk about your hypothesis in your results, just state if the p-value is significant or not"
2101,2_writing,6_holistic,"Again, write this as if I have no idea about any of this."
2102,2_writing,4_specific,Your intro needs a lot more work. Include regular nerve/muscle function to lead into why you expect your blocker to work.
2103,3_technical,4_specific,These are raw data. You only need to report average R:S mass and average R:S length
2104,3_technical,4_specific,This (and all of the other day observations) is raw data.  This is summed up well in your graphs and does not need to be included this way.
2105,3_technical,4_specific,Are you sure? They are a pest during the larval phase.
2106,2_writing,4_specific,"When you write an abstract, think of it as a summary of all of your sections of your lab report. So, pick the most important things from your methods, results, and discussions and put it in here. [didn’t follow-up]"
2107,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is the first time that you mentioned this hormone
2108,4_logic,4_specific,Then why did the results support the hypothesis? They are suggesting that the muscle response did not change with the injection of lidocaine.
2109,3_technical,4_specific,"No titles on graphs, y-axis needs a label and there are errors with your standard dev bars"
2110,4_logic,3_general,Is this a conclusion?
2111,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Please report your means +/- SDs, but otherwise, good results section!"
2112,3_technical,4_specific,You still needed to introduce your study organism more in this section
2113,3_technical,4_specific,"I’m confused by all these numbers, what are they saying and why are there standard deviations with single values?"
2114,3_technical,3_general,Be consistent between using abs and percent change
2115,3_technical,8_nobasis,Why just one standard deviation?
2116,3_technical,3_general,Where are the captions in this? Is this all the data from the table? See me if you’re confused
2117,4_logic,6_holistic,"If full sunlight have the largest R:S, doesn’t that mean that plants are allocating more energy to roots than shoots?"
2118,2_writing,3_general,"Hypotheses are never correct/incorrect. Rather, they are/aren’t “supported” by your data"
2119,3_technical,2_copyedit,Roughly 70µL
2120,3_technical,4_specific,Why is this species helpful to study? What muscle are you using?
2121,3_technical,4_specific,"Well, not the t-test, because the p-value wasn’t significant, but the bar graph certainly does suggest that, yes."
2122,3_technical,3_general,"I need the numbers (averages, sd’s, stats) all in results"
2123,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard dev?
2124,2_writing,3_general,Your intro needs to be heavily condensed – focus on ideas that are central to leading the reader to your research question and hypothesis
2125,3_technical,4_specific,You need statistics to say this
2126,3_technical,6_holistic,"There are several things wrong with this chart, I count at least 3, try to fix this and then meet with me to go over it."
2127,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Fix this up, I think we talked about it"
2128,3_technical,4_specific,"This is the wrong phrase to use here, as it sort of implies you just stumbled upon your data. You could say there is not enough statistical evidence to support that your results occurred by chance, not your data"
2129,3_technical,1_pointer,?
2130,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Do not write an entire sentences only for the statistical outcome. Remember that statistics is just a tool to the result, so you need to mention the direct observation.Remember the example that we analyzed in lab last week."
2131,4_logic,4_specific,Doesn’t this prediction contradict your earlier claims?

2424,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would include the actual p-value
2425,4_logic,6_holistic,"Right, so until now you have limited your interpretation of the data to just reduced vision and energetic costs of aggression. Can you talk a little more about the implications or interpretation of there being a significant reduction of aggressive behaviors in the murky water, i.e. the native habitat, of these aquarium fish?  I think this is an important aspect of your study and would be interested to hear what your ideas are."
2426,2_writing,6_holistic,Be careful here—it almost sounds as if you’re calling Physarum a multicellular organism too.

2678,3_technical,4_specific,"Not true. Getting an insignificant p-value does NOT mean that you did the experiment wrong. If the p-value is very insignificant (0.9, for example), then there is simply no measurable effect from the treatment you used, but that is a result, not a sign that the experiment was wrong. If the p-value is close to significant (like yours), that means that while the results are not statistically significant, you did see a biologically significant result and your hypothesis might have been supported."

2715,3_technical,4_specific,What groups were compared?
2716,3_technical,4_specific,Say whether or not it was significant specifically
2717,2_writing,2_copyedit,It’s helpful for me (or anyone reading this) if you say something like “We hypothesize that…” or “The hypothesis is…” instead of simply stating it.
2718,4_logic,4_specific,"See if you can say (more clearly) why you think changing the amount of E20 will have this effect. Also, you didn’t increase E20, you inhibited it."

2721,3_technical,4_specific,No need to include the concentration in the intro (save it for methods0
2722,4_logic,4_specific,Procedural error could be one reason. Maybe the chloroplasts were not successfully isolated.

2735,2_writing,4_specific,"Don’t include methods here, but instead, summarize the trends."
2736,2_writing,6_holistic,I like your intro up to here. Can you summarize what these biochemical pathways mean for the whole plant as a transition into your hypothesis? What do they mean for growth of various tissues?
2737,4_logic,6_holistic,Good start w/ comparing your results to other studies. But need to talk about biological mechanisms here. How does green light cause a resource limitation?
2738,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is unnecessary info
2739,4_logic,4_specific,"Okay, I buy this can you zoom out now to think more about what this can teach us about the power (or rate) of evolution in these fish? Since I know they’ve been artificially selected to be aggressive in clear water, I would have predicted a significant difference, which you did not find here. Can you elaborate?"

Again try to only state the pertinent information, any decision making you may have gone through you don’t need to talk about just state what you did. Try to summarize the amount of chemicals section as well, you added x mL of x% chemical."
2743,2_writing,4_specific,What happened to your concluding sentence about the broader importance of this research? You didn’t have to delete that (or the other study) just because you added this new information.
2744,3_technical,4_specific,"Where are your error bars?! Also, be more specific with your legend—0mM of what?"
2745,3_technical,4_specific,"Be specific here. What was the rpm, duration, and temperature? What part was centrifuged, which was discarded and therefore used for the rest of the experiment?"
2746,4_logic,3_general,"Your results should not support your lab manual. On the contrary, you are trying to support your result with previous knowledge."
2747,4_logic,4_specific,What lead you to want to study salinity? What’s the big picture?
2748,2_writing,2_copyedit,it was
2749,3_technical,4_specific,The stats say that your hypothesis is not supported
2750,3_technical,4_specific,"Above, you say that you measured masses. But you only talk about the results for length here. Would be good to show the data for all of the measurements you talk about in the methods section"
2751,3_technical,4_specific,"Still have this backwards. Think of “p value” was being “the probability that a difference is just due to chance”. It’s a number 0-1. Since you p value is big, that means that theres a large probability that your difference is just due to chance. In other words, big p value = no effect of your treatment"
2752,3_technical,3_general,Make sure all figures included in the report are referenced in the results (and other sections as needed).
2753,3_technical,4_specific,Can you specify the statistical test used?
2754,2_writing,1_pointer,?
2755,3_technical,4_specific,This table doesn’t represent your data well.  These means do not have +/- error but they also do not explain that there were three legs.Try using a (maybe multiple) bar graph to represent the data.  Include error bars.

2762,2_writing,3_general,Intro material!
2763,3_technical,4_specific,"Your group actually used an E20 inhibitor, not an E20 mimic. This may change some of your intro and discussion content."

2765,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? What does JH have to do with weight?
2766,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations mean nothing without an average
2767,2_writing,4_specific,Avoid repeating words in consecutive sentences. That makes the manuscript bored. Remember that you didn’t have three frog legs and three injected legs.
2768,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Your figures don’t need titles, because they will have captions."
2769,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should state if your hypothesis was supported or not and list the p-value
2770,3_technical,2_copyedit,Same here. No need to tell the readers what your tube numbers are
2771,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
2772,2_writing,2_copyedit,In discussion you reported your incubation time as ~27 hours. Not consistent.
2773,3_technical,4_specific,This table is unnecessary since you mentioned the p-value in the intro.

3070,2_writing,2_copyedit,After the incubation period
3071,2_writing,2_copyedit,Is this necessary?
3072,4_logic,4_specific,You could mention that doses used in the present study was low and then recommend the use of a higher doses.
3073,3_technical,2_copyedit,Error bars
3074,2_writing,4_specific,"Most of this discussion section is still restating the results section. Need to focus on discussing biological mechanisms, reviewing the literature, and comparing to other studies"
3075,3_technical,2_copyedit,Do not support
3076,2_writing,2_copyedit,unnecessary
3077,4_logic,4_specific,"You need to focus more on the biological explanation of your results i.e. mycorrhizae’s effect on roots. At least explain why you still think your hypothesis still to be valid despite your results. You also fail to explain why R:S length, but not mass was significant."
3078,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Include weight or length in the y-axis, otherwise it is difficult to tell the graphs apart at first glance."
3079,4_logic,4_specific,"Be more specific with your hypothesis. What specifically do you expect will happen in the Manduca when Azamax is introduced? Increasd mass, decreased mass, etc. Within your abstract, you mentioned that a previous study showed ecdysterone blockers inhibited growth. I would cite this within your introduction and use it to hypothesize that Azamax would lead to decreased mass."
3080,3_technical,4_specific,You are missing one step in between. The first action potential (AP) stimulates the release of Ach and the Ach in the postsynaptic membrane allows Na+ and K+ channels to open which generates the secondAP
3081,3_technical,4_specific,Attached to a force transducer to record contraction
3082,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can leave this as “mM”Which stands for millimolar (different from millimol)
3083,3_technical,4_specific,You should explain that you were using a force transducer (that’s what the frog legs were actually suspended from) to measure muscle twitch.
3084,3_technical,4_specific,I would explain how you made this 20x solution.
3085,3_technical,2_copyedit,t-test
3086,2_writing,4_specific,Can you expand on this a bit? Make the definitions of plasticity and resource allocation really clear for a reader. Good job of integrating a relevant source to support your hypothesis.
3087,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure to also include the concentration
3088,4_logic,4_specific,No real mention of the cellular mechanism in here
3089,3_technical,4_specific,These methods are too general.  Include more specific information about what you did.
3090,2_writing,3_general,"Your abstract needs a little work, try to reorganize it so it reads a little like a summary of your whole paper. Make sure you have results in here; did it work or didn’t it."
3091,3_technical,2_copyedit,"State the species and muscle used, and then insert the “why is this helpful” stuff from below that I also commented on"
3092,3_technical,2_copyedit,Your captions need statistics and need to mention your error bars
3093,4_logic,4_specific,I don’t understand your point with this.
3094,3_technical,2_copyedit,Good caption! But maybe include p-values from a Tukey-Kramer.
3095,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Gah! Keep that figure reference in there, always!"
3096,3_technical,3_general,You wouldn’t have been able to test this with your experimental setup.
3097,2_writing,4_specific,"You can trim this down by cutting out information that is unnecessary, don’t tell people how exactly you increased the stimulus voltage, just say that you increased it; things like that"
3098,2_writing,2_copyedit,this should be removed or better integrated
3099,3_technical,4_specific,Why paired? I’m not sure that makes sense here. Please let me know and ask if you have any questions!
3100,4_logic,6_holistic,I don’t see the correlation. Why would the bettas use energy to defend itself against non-aggressive guppies?
3101,3_technical,2_copyedit,corpus allatum
3102,3_technical,2_copyedit,Screenshot just the figure not the whole screen
3103,3_technical,4_specific,Why’d you want this pellet?
3104,4_logic,4_specific,you didn’t mention anything about your inhibitor neomycin. You need to provide this info justified by primary lit
3105,3_technical,2_copyedit,"So, source."
3106,2_writing,3_general,Make the necessity for this information a little more clear.
3107,3_technical,3_general,Please see p. 42 of your resource guide for correct citation format
3108,2_writing,4_specific,This comes later when discussing your results
3109,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data and I would not include it
3110,4_logic,4_specific,Stay focused on resource allocation in plants. This sentence doesn’t get any closer to your hypothesis
3111,2_writing,4_specific,You need to introduce Qb first. What is it? Pretend I’m a high schooler reading this. Then write!
3112,2_writing,3_general,"Make sure you are keeping to relevant information, we only need significant background on the hormone that you will be targeting."
3113,3_technical,4_specific,"This is a lot of graphs. I would include only the bar graphs, as the line graphs are not super necessary and don’t add a whole lot to your paper"
3114,3_technical,4_specific,"If you mention this, calculate it and present that number here"
3115,2_writing,3_general,Introduce your research question more subtly
3116,2_writing,2_copyedit,This doesn’t need to be in parenthesis
3117,2_writing,4_specific,This should come after the introduction of allocation
3118,3_technical,2_copyedit,Are these p-values?
3119,3_technical,4_specific,Introduction requires substantially more detail especially related to background literature that is similar to your study or provides support for making your hypothesis
3120,2_writing,3_general,"Find a way to make this more concise, and think about that as you revise your reports as a whole."
3121,4_logic,4_specific,"If your experiment is just about male behavior, then it’s unclear why you discuss “interact with a female” in the abstract above"
3122,3_technical,2_copyedit,Roughly 30~100µL
3123,3_technical,2_copyedit,You could include the values here like you did in the figure caption
3124,3_technical,2_copyedit,remove (Methods details 2)
3125,3_technical,2_copyedit,Refer to it by name/number (e.g. “Figure 1”) so people can find it in the graphs section
3126,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I would say what you used instead (Azamax, IGR, or exdysterone blocker)"
3127,2_writing,3_general,Be careful only to use scientific language
3128,2_writing,4_specific,"If you mention this, you’re going to have to actually talk about the experiment they did"
3129,2_writing,4_specific,"You don’t need this sentence, the abstract kind of did this for you, just jump right in with the next sentence"
3130,3_technical,4_specific,Can you be more specific about this? Mention what was each condition
3131,3_technical,4_specific,What % concentration does that give you?
3132,4_logic,4_specific,"You talk about other males vs. their own reflection, but you’re still missing some discussion of why size would matter"
3133,3_technical,3_general,Please refer to the BioCore Resource Guide to reformat your in-text citations.
3134,3_technical,4_specific,What reagent are we using for this reaction? How does its change in absorbance represent photosynthetic rate?
3135,3_technical,2_copyedit,Not considered a primary resource
3136,3_technical,4_specific,Also introduce statistical tests you performed to analyze the data
3137,3_technical,4_specific,0.86 > 0.05 Not significant
3138,3_technical,2_copyedit,units
3139,2_writing,2_copyedit,No!!! Never proof!
3140,3_technical,4_specific,Use standard error instead of standard deviation. Standard error is standard deviation divided by the square root of sample size
3141,2_writing,3_general,"I get what you’re saying, but try to make this a little more clear."
3142,3_technical,4_specific,"Your stats were significant because 0.01 is less than 0.05.This is not qualitative data, its quantitative. The t-test doesn’t care what your hypothesis was, it only cared about the numbers you put into it.  Your data is significant that the contraction period shortened and the only manipulation was the injection of A23, thus its probably A23 that caused this."
3143,3_technical,4_specific,"Are you sure? How many drops did you add? 1 drop = 50uL, so for 1mL you should add 20 drops. Was that your doses? If not, then do the corresponding calculations."
3144,3_technical,4_specific,What data? The mean percent change values?
3145,2_writing,4_specific,"Include one sentence about how juvenile hormone normally behaves in Manduca, include your hypothesis, and then state if your hypothesis was supported or rejected at the end"
3146,3_technical,2_copyedit,Turn this into a percent rather than a ratio and it’ll shorten the sentence a lot (x% Azamax)
3147,3_technical,3_general,Statistics outcome. Were those changes significantly different between groups? That should be included in this section.
3148,3_technical,4_specific,Analyze by treatment vs control means.
3149,3_technical,2_copyedit,State the figure numbers
3150,3_technical,4_specific,I can tell you that this was not the case. All our frogs are about the same age and are killed just before lab starts.
3151,3_technical,3_general,No URLs for peer reviewed articles.
3152,3_technical,4_specific,Use the means (average) for each group to graph your data. You were looking for the effect of IGR between 2 groups and not between replicates. As you can see in Fig. 1; the groups next to each other are not experimentally paired.
3153,2_writing,4_specific,Be careful here! We don’t want anything that sounds like interpretation in the results section—only discussion!
3154,3_technical,4_specific,You should introduce the chemical that you will be using first.
3155,2_writing,4_specific,You need to state your hypothesis near the beginning of your abstract. I would suggest condensing the explanation for muscle contraction to give you room for this.
3156,2_writing,3_general,"This is also far too long. Try to focus on giving a clear-succinct interpretation of your results early on in your discussion. Honestly, I couldn’t interpret your results because these sections were so long, and there was just too much to focus on."
3157,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not sure if this is the best word choice. “Noticeable” or “notable” or even “large” might be better words.
3158,3_technical,2_copyedit,Alpha?
3159,2_writing,6_holistic,"Start by talking about resource allocation or other concepts covered in this unit  - set the reader up to think about the context for your experiment. Overall, I think your intro is structured well, but you need to fill in some gaps to make it flow more smoothly. Perhaps you could dedicate 1-2 sentences to the mechanisms behind plant responses to light/shade – what is going on in a plant that makes it change its allocation patterns based on light availability?"
3160,4_logic,4_specific,Procedural error could be one reason. Maybe the chloroplasts were not successfully isolated. Recall that you did not actually look through the microscope and calculated relative chloroplast density this time. It could be error at maintaining the temp during the experiments. Explore possible reasons!
3161,1_basic,4_specific,Don’t mention your hypothesis in the results section
3162,4_logic,3_general,Also explore the possible reasons why your herbicide experiment didn’t turn out the way you expected
3163,3_technical,4_specific,This is part of the results because those were direct observations from the experiment
3164,4_logic,4_specific,"This is a good addition. If water quantity doesn’t matter, does water quality? That’s essentially the question you are asking here."
3165,3_technical,2_copyedit,You need statistics and description of error bars in your caption. There should not be a title in the body of the figure.
3166,2_writing,2_copyedit,Just say dilution
3167,3_technical,4_specific,"How did you calculate these standard deviation values? The standard deviation should be based on your initial values that were averaged to get the value shown, so you should probably not have the same standard deviation for both your control and treatment."
3168,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, both your error bars look very similar to each other so I am not sure if they are correct."
3169,3_technical,3_general,Need more detail in the figure captions
3170,2_writing,4_specific,Why is the Ca++ released? You can connect this sentence and the previous
3171,3_technical,4_specific,"See my comments on your figure caption, as I think this would be less confusing with one bar graph. Be sure to put averages with standard deviations when you fix the graph"
3172,3_technical,3_general,Don’t include raw data
3173,3_technical,2_copyedit,0.99 ± 0.50
3174,2_writing,3_general,Try not to end on a citation from someone else-s work. Can you make a broad statement that does not require citation about why this matters?
3175,2_writing,3_general,Colloquial language
3176,3_technical,4_specific,"True, but this claim would benefit from a citation"
3177,3_technical,6_holistic,"To compare what, exactly. The number of red manes for a single fish? For both fish added together? Something else?"
3178,1_basic,3_general,Primary literature in Discussion
3179,3_technical,2_copyedit,And then accepted by NADPH…
3180,3_technical,3_general,This caption is a little too brief
3181,3_technical,2_copyedit,What are the means and standard devs? State those here
3182,3_technical,2_copyedit,We don’t use cell bio manual
3183,3_technical,4_specific,"You didn’t talk about the threshold or the amplitude of contraction, but you have figures for that. That is important and you need to include it here. Reference the figures in this section"
3184,2_writing,3_general,"Finally, you need to clean up your writing throughout the body of the lab report."
3185,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly)"
3186,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviation
3187,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, did the same people observe the fish each time to minimize bias? Explain exactly how you tallied the points."
3188,1_basic,4_specific,"Don’t talk about supporting or rejecting your hypothesis in the results, save it for the discussion"
3189,3_technical,4_specific,"Careful, insignificant p-values mean that the means of each treatment group were effectively the same."
3190,3_technical,3_general,This is not the right use of null hypothesis.
3191,3_technical,2_copyedit,List the stats
3192,2_writing,4_specific,Can you specify at least the studied physiological process? Not just say on Rana pipiens
3193,3_technical,2_copyedit,mM
3194,3_technical,4_specific,Which one? Post hoc test?
3195,3_technical,8_nobasis,y-axis
3196,3_technical,4_specific,Need some references here when you’re talking about the effects of acid rain on plants.
3197,3_technical,2_copyedit,Partially supported.
3198,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Due to the uncertain nature of science, avoid words such as “correct” as your data can be interpreted differently by others. As such, I would use “supported”"
3199,3_technical,4_specific,Statistical tests do not need a separate table. You only need to mention the test used in the methods and the p-value in the results/discussion as you have already done.
3200,3_technical,4_specific,I would just say it’s insignificant and talk about what that means in the discussion.
3201,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Again, not the null hypothesis and not in the right place."
3202,3_technical,4_specific,"So your error bars are +/- one standard deviation, but the value of that standard deviation is 0.11."
3203,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
3204,3_technical,4_specific,But what amount did you inject?
3205,3_technical,4_specific,Your axes need labels
3206,3_technical,4_specific,Error bars?
3207,3_technical,2_copyedit,How did you keep the leg stable? Specify that it was pinned to the dissecting tray.
3208,3_technical,4_specific,"Were your standard deviations for control and experimental similar to each other? If not, your error bars may have been improperly formatted"
3209,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
3210,3_technical,2_copyedit,"[Johnson:2018], make sure to state this at the end of every sentence that you use information from it"
3211,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format is [last name : year]
3212,2_writing,3_general,"Never quote literature, only paraphrase"
3213,3_technical,2_copyedit,Tails?
3214,2_writing,4_specific,This is the kind of stuff I want to see in the methods!
3215,3_technical,2_copyedit,Try to write this without the labels and tube numbers
3216,4_logic,3_general,Also be careful when coming up with biological reasons for results for your presentation.
3217,2_writing,4_specific,Can you be more precise with the title? It is ambiguous
3218,2_writing,4_specific,"Again, this does not belong in the intro."
3219,3_technical,4_specific,What is the x-axis?
3220,3_technical,4_specific,"This is a little confusing, so did you only collect data on the behaviors or one fish or on both of them? Where is the methods for murky water? What values did you actually run the t-test on – “significant values” isn’t very informative. How many tails did your t-test have?"
3221,4_logic,4_specific,You did not talk about this at all earlier so I wouldn’t bring it up at the very end
3222,3_technical,2_copyedit,3 plants? Or 3 groups of plants
3223,3_technical,2_copyedit,Just reference your figure; you don’t need to describe what it shows here.
3224,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not the best term to define the effect that you observed.
3225,2_writing,4_specific,"If you generalize since the beginning, you can omit this."
3226,3_technical,4_specific,"Re-check this value, it is too large. Also, follow this format t-stat=_, d.f.=_, p=_"
3227,3_technical,2_copyedit,Delete gridlines
3228,2_writing,2_copyedit,You mention this in the methods so you shouldn’t have to mention it here.
3229,3_technical,4_specific,"You didn’t reference this table in the text. Tables and figures should be referred in the corresponding results section. This table is repeating the information of the figures, so you could omit it."
3230,4_logic,3_general,This doesn’t seem to have much to do with the rest of your paper.
3231,3_technical,4_specific,Why are we using this organism? Why is it helpful to study?
3232,3_technical,4_specific,Mentioning the plant species would be more informative.
3233,3_technical,3_general,Do not write the methods like instruction. Write the methods in past tense
3234,2_writing,4_specific,This statement looks like if you were testing the efficiency of the blocker. That was not the idea.
3235,3_technical,2_copyedit,Reagent Table
3236,3_technical,2_copyedit,Don’t use the word significantly unless you’re talking about something that is backed up by statistics
3237,4_logic,6_holistic,You need to better introduce the costs and benefits of aggression in order for your reader to understand the underlying logic of your hypothesis. Why is food a relevant stimulus? What do previous studies support?
3238,2_writing,4_specific,"Pretty solid introduction, just make sure you explain the specific motivation / mechanism of change."
3239,3_technical,6_holistic,"In both the introduction and discussion, you listed a lot of the effects of JH as an attribute of ecdysterone. I would recommend looking again at the role of ecdysterone in the Manduca’s normal life cycle."
3240,2_writing,4_specific,You need a sentence relating your findings back to the big picture
3241,3_technical,4_specific,Why else? (rationale for model)
3242,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include data in parenthesis.
3243,1_basic,4_specific,Where is your hypothesis?
3244,3_technical,2_copyedit,Pupa?
3245,3_technical,4_specific,"Consider adding one more sentence of explanation to this caption, such as describing your color key."
3246,2_writing,3_general,"Always, always avoid words like this. We scientists never prove anything, no matter how hard we try…"
3247,2_writing,4_specific,Can you be more specific? Emphasize the hormone that was altered with the administration of Martin’s IGR.
3248,3_technical,2_copyedit,"DF, T-stat?"
3249,2_writing,3_general,A good concluding sentence here would be appreciated
3250,3_technical,4_specific,Move this to the end of the section so that the methods are in chronological order. Which data did you test (total points for both fish? Points for just one of the fish?)
3251,3_technical,4_specific,Is this your definition of contraction?
3252,3_technical,3_general,"You reported the means and standard deviations correctly in your original version, and now I see they have been removed here. Those should be included. You did report the results of the t-test correctly, so next time make sure you include all of the necessary information and you will have a great results section"
3253,2_writing,4_specific,The first time you state Aceteylcholine add (ACh) so the reader knows what this means every other time
3254,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Also, is there any significance result for this? Either in ANOVA or Tukey? Include that instead."
3255,2_writing,2_copyedit,I’d just get rid of this.
3256,2_writing,3_general,this could mean something else.. I would rephrase
3257,3_technical,4_specific,These Error bars look identical in magnitude.
3258,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the year published.
3259,2_writing,4_specific,Include this in paragraph form in your results section.
3260,3_technical,3_general,You should reference your figure in here.
3261,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations? Stats?
3262,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Much better. A note for the future, whenever you list averages, you should also have +/- a standard deviation"
3263,3_technical,4_specific,"A filter excludes all light, but the red wavelength. Not the other way around."
3264,2_writing,3_general,Be very careful with your paraphrasing in the future. This is very similar to the direct quotes you had
3265,2_writing,3_general,Revise
3266,3_technical,2_copyedit,0.1mL
3267,3_technical,4_specific,How did you summarize and analyze your raw data?
3268,2_writing,4_specific,"You can cut this unless you think it is really relevant, try to keep the trends you talk about general and relevant."
3269,3_technical,4_specific,I understand you might point out leg 3 as a possible outlier but what made you believe the connection between the nerve/muscle in leg 3 was the specific issue? I would write this explanation to justify your claim.
3270,2_writing,3_general,Be careful not to switch from 1st person plural to 1st person singular. Stay consistent
3271,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Should be brackets [], not parentheses ()"
3272,2_writing,3_general,informal

3275,4_logic,4_specific,"Really good introduction, but give me something about green light and where you think it will fall in the spectrum of promoting photosynthetic activity."
3276,3_technical,4_specific,I would average the 2 controls together and the 2 experimentals together and display this as a graph.
3277,3_technical,3_general,"You need a little bit more in this figure caption, consult the core resource guide and your primary literature to see."
3278,3_technical,4_specific,"Try to summarize your methods in a better way without putting too much detail. For example, all the procedure to isolate 200 ul into microtubes with labels A, B, B pellet, and C can be condensed in a single line stating that the sample containing the pellet after second centrifuge was used. Because if you followed the protocol properly to isolate the chloroplast, you should have the highest chloroplast in your B pellet sample."

3310,3_technical,4_specific,Make sure that all of these citations are actually referenced in the text
3311,3_technical,4_specific,"Good graph, but not a complete caption. What do the different colors represent? What do the error bars represent? Are these averages? If so, how many caterpillars were averaged?"

3320,3_technical,4_specific,"Since the p values were greater than 0.05, this means that there wasn’t a significant difference. Which means that your treatment didn’t cause a change in resource allocation. You had this interpretation correct on your first submission"

3326,3_technical,3_general,See p.42 in the BioCore Resource Guide for correct in-text citation format (not the same as the annotation exercise)
3327,4_logic,4_specific,Citation? This is a bold claim. Back it up with some literature
3328,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
3329,3_technical,4_specific,Revise. From this statement it seems that your time interval between readings were not consistent. Make sure you clearly indicate that you took readings at five minute intervals over a period of thirty minutes.
3330,2_writing,4_specific,"This is good, but you should start by introducing intraspecific behavior and its importance. Make sure you talk about its costs and benefits."
3331,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the respective stats values associated with the figure
3332,2_writing,6_holistic,Informal. Revise to make it formal. Use your best judgement to locate any other informal/colloquial terms/texts/formats used elsewhere in the report and revise accordingly.

3334,3_technical,4_specific,"Don’t put the specific drop amount in your hypothesis, just explain it in your methods."
3335,2_writing,4_specific,"You should include a paragraph of some observations you made during your experiment, rather then just having figures and captions.  This could include observations, a sentence form of your final results (i.e. the average weight change), the statistics results, and any interesting observations you saw."
3336,3_technical,4_specific,"You did this before you added DCPIP, so this should go before that."
3337,2_writing,4_specific,Should reflect highlights from discussion as well.
3338,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is unnecessary here. You already mentioned in the results and you specified that the difference were significant.
3339,2_writing,4_specific,Hypothesis comes before methods
3340,3_technical,4_specific,"According to this, the eight caterpillars were treated with Martin’s IGR"

3353,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence does not make sense
3354,3_technical,4_specific,These error bars are identical and not the magnitude you say they are in your figure caption. This figure has a title and it should not.
3355,4_logic,3_general,Doesn’t make sense with the hypothesis

3359,3_technical,2_copyedit,I’m assuming this is the same year as the citation from the sentence before?
3360,4_logic,6_holistic,Good job talking about energy use. But would be good to give some references about why size would matter. Why would a fish feel more threatened by a larger opponent?
3361,4_logic,2_copyedit,Please embed your (in)dependent variables in your hypothesis.

3363,3_technical,2_copyedit,Just say what you saw a trend in your data.
3364,4_logic,4_specific,"Why did you predict this? Check your lab manual information or other sources. Higher levels of JH inhibit pupation, but stimulate the molting to another larval stage. In other words, the animals require higher levels of JH to molt from one larval instar to the next larval instar."
3365,4_logic,4_specific,"How? Readers should understand why you make the prediction you do (and not the opposite, for example)"
3366,2_writing,4_specific,Make sure you have some version of your hypothesis near the beginning of your abstract so that readers understand that you were testing something and not just running this experiment without any expected outcome.

Your explanation of the effect on vision is good."

3378,3_technical,4_specific,How was photosynthesis specifically altered? Energy availability of the light? You need to be specific here as well.
3379,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
3380,3_technical,4_specific,How did you decide sig values?
3381,2_writing,3_general,This is unclear

3388,2_writing,2_copyedit,Capitalize first letters
3389,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.

3447,3_technical,3_general,Missing citations in this section.
3448,3_technical,4_specific,You can’t have standard deviations on just one value. Check this graph and it’s values
3449,3_technical,4_specific,Why did you conduct statistical analysis? Did you do it to find errors?
3450,4_logic,6_holistic,This still relates to Physarum only. What about broader scale comparison with other organism models?

3453,3_technical,4_specific,"How did you do the scoring, did one person always judge what the fish were doing, did each group member score the fish independently and you averaged the values, or something else? Be clear that you conducted the t-test to look for sig differences between total points scored between the fish in clear and fish in murky water. What you have here doesn’t quite say that."
3454,2_writing,7_idiomatic,This got cut off by the 200 word limit.  Next time copy paste it into the intro so it doesn’t get cut off and I can grade it.   (don’t worry about it)I was going to ask for a sentence about why you got these results but you were probably about to say that before being cut off.
3455,3_technical,2_copyedit,What was the concentration?
3456,4_logic,3_general,"Don’t assume you did it wrong. Just because you didn’t obtain the expected results, it doesn’t mean there were errors. Try to find a biological explanation for the results."
3457,3_technical,4_specific,The error bars themselves were formatted properly but did you use the same standard deviation for all of them? Each day should have a separate standard deviation as they used 4 separate values for an average.

3474,3_technical,4_specific,"Much of this section is out of place. In the results section, just briefly state the general trends and give the p values… “xx was greater than yyy (p = zzz, Figure 1)”        Then in the discussion section, avoid just re-stating the results. Instead, draw inference about your hypotheses and discussion biological mechanisms… “The data supported my hypothesis that xxx would cause an increase in R:S.

(Ex. I think you found the standard deviation between 0.061, 0.093, and 0.22 in table 2 rather than finding the standard deviation among the 4 readings you averaged to get 0.061. and the 4 readings averaged to get 0.093. and the 4 readings averaged to get 0.22)"
3486,4_logic,4_specific,You should exclude nitrogen from this lab report since you could not collect any data

3507,3_technical,4_specific,I wouldn’t call this incorrect. I would just label it as a possible outlier (Can’t claim it definitively is an outlier unless you perform another statistical test on it which needs a larger sample size).
3508,2_writing,3_general,Can you revise your hypothesis to make it more clearer and straight forward?
3509,3_technical,3_general,This is not proper citation format and you should have at least 3 citations

3536,3_technical,4_specific,"As the 3 graphs above are considered raw data, I would only include this graph. However, your error bars seem to not be formatted properly. If you need help with formatting them, make sure to contact me."
3537,4_logic,4_specific,"True, but isn’t root length / mass more indicative of cell division than the size of individual cells?"
3538,4_logic,4_specific,You did not tell me enough about why this study is important to your experiment.
3539,2_writing,3_general,You need to use more scientific language and connect your findings back to the big picture
3540,2_writing,3_general,Use past tense for the methods section
3541,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If you change the x-axis, you will not need to specify this. The reader can understand which bar correspond to each treatment."
3542,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format [Johnson: 2018]

3544,4_logic,3_general,"In the future, it would be good to discuss more biological mechanisms like this, and less sources of error"
3545,2_writing,2_copyedit,Just say our results
3546,3_technical,4_specific,In both spinach and kale? To the same degree?
3547,3_technical,2_copyedit,Did you mean control group?
3548,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Get more specific, mL and concentrations are necessary"
3549,3_technical,4_specific,No need for title on the graph. Need to have x axis labels instead of the legend
3550,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
3551,3_technical,4_specific,Same problem with the error bars
3552,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much did you inject?
3553,2_writing,3_general,This or something like this would be great to use as your “bigger picture”
3554,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Just say that these measurements were averaged, then used for a t-test."
3555,2_writing,3_general,Rhetorical questions are not necessary in a scientific intro
3556,4_logic,4_specific,How does this relate to aggression? I don’t see the connection to your expeirment
3557,3_technical,3_general,"Your graph should not have a title, put what your title would be in your caption."
3558,3_technical,2_copyedit,"When reporting the results of a two-sample t-test, you need to include the resulting t-statistic, the degrees of freedom (df), and the corresponding P-value. Your statement might look like this, “The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.57, df = 26, P = 0.574).”"

3564,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use?
3565,4_logic,6_holistic,"What lead you to think this? How would manipulating 20E levels affect growth, go past just “timing of molt”"
3566,3_technical,4_specific,"So, both variables decreased ???"
3567,2_writing,4_specific,Can you define the term threshold? That is necessary. Also consider the position of this sentence in the paragraph. This would be better after you explain the excitation-contractile process.

3571,4_logic,4_specific,"It’s not necessarily that they don’t have the means to grow stems and leaves, it’s that cell functions are resource limited. Think of them as limiting reactants in a chemical reaction; without adequate soil nutrients the plant cannot survive, so it prioritizes the collection of scarce resources."
3572,3_technical,4_specific,"Instead of looking for differences in aggression of each individual, could you use your data to test (or at least, support) this observation? I think that should be possible, and it would be more informative than looking for the individual differences."
3573,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not included in Table 1

3581,4_logic,4_specific,Suggestion about reaction buffer should have explored other studies to propose specific alternative
3582,3_technical,4_specific,This is the correct info that you should have in your results in paragraph form. You should include a sentence about what the length and weight overall change averages are here too.
3583,4_logic,6_holistic,Why would prolonging the pupal stage make it lose weight? Does that make sense?
3584,3_technical,4_specific,Did you add buffer?
3585,2_writing,4_specific,I would move this to the end of your introduction.
3586,4_logic,3_general,What is the typical pattern of resource allocation? How does it change?
3587,3_technical,4_specific,"What do your error bars represent? Also, you don’t need error bars if you aren’t averaging values together."
3588,4_logic,4_specific,"You could recognize some patterns here, though. For example, compare 10% treatment of both of your species. Your chard samples had much smaller p-values compared to spinach. So, chard could possibly show better results than spinach if you refine your methods and conduct your experiment again. Although you got statistically insignificant values, look for a pattern and see which could be a good candidate or show a better result next time if you improve your methods."
3589,2_writing,2_copyedit,Kind of silly to start abbreviating it here and then use the abbreviation one other time

3607,3_technical,6_holistic,"If your y-axis is a ratio, do you think it should have units? Why or why not? Be more specific about your error bars – what do they actually represent? Variation isn’t a very informative term."

3610,3_technical,1_pointer,Are you sure about this?
3611,3_technical,4_specific,This is not peculiar of the skeletal muscle. All the muscles types respond with a contraction.
3612,3_technical,4_specific,Did you calculate means?
3613,3_technical,4_specific,What were their findings?
3614,3_technical,4_specific,"I forgot to mention this, but explain how your get form absorbance to your data that you’ll analyze. So, absorbance, to percent change, to means."
3615,2_writing,3_general,Include more supporting background information. A lot more needs to be written here for full credit.
3616,4_logic,4_specific,"This would make sense if your hypothesis HAD been supported. What do you make of the fact that there was no significant difference, though? You get to it in the following sentences, but your discussion should make logical sense and not contradict itself. The source you cite looks like it should have some good information in it that will help you build your argument; you can even compare what you found to the results of that study."

3631,3_technical,4_specific,"Is this true? Did you test Na+ channels. No, you tested the muscle contraction, so the effect of lidocaine in the Na+ channels (from previous studies, not yours) could be the explanation of the results."

3643,2_writing,3_general,You need a more descriptive title. See your group members or me for suggestions.
3644,2_writing,4_specific,This sentence should say something about supporting your hypothesis (you want to establish this early in the discussion)
3645,2_writing,3_general,Should be all in past tense.
3646,3_technical,4_specific,This needs to be in full sentences. Where are results of your statistical tests? 2 sig figs is enough.
3647,3_technical,4_specific,"Your figures need an x-axis label (“Frog treatment” for example), and you need to explain what the error bars represent here in the caption/legend."

3699,2_writing,3_general,"I asked you to trim this down and make it more succinct, but it’s longer than the submission."
3700,3_technical,4_specific,Which ANOVA and post hoc test?
3701,4_logic,4_specific,"While discussing what went wrong, in addition to procedural error, think about the concentration of reaction buffer that I mentioned in an earlier email. You used 1x reaction buffer throughout for your control and treatment group. Could using a different concentration (such as 2x) reaction buffer be a better approach? Also, think about how efficient you were in isolating the chloroplasts. Think about the step in your method about chloroplast isolation and propose a way for improvement."
3702,3_technical,4_specific,Need to state which statistical test you would do
3703,4_logic,6_holistic,Okay… this is a bit of a stretch and I think there’s a simpler interpretation. Think about the energetic costs of constantly displaying aggressive behaviors vs. using a shelter.

3733,4_logic,4_specific,Procedural error could be one reason. Maybe the chloroplasts were not successfully isolated.

3769,2_writing,3_general,I would try to reword this too.
3770,3_technical,2_copyedit,You did not use proper citation format
3771,3_technical,4_specific,"Meaning, points for the two fish were added together? A paired t-test would be more appropriate here."
3772,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should just have the last name of the first author
3773,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Are the data themselves not significant, or is it that the difference between the two groups is not significant?"
3774,4_logic,4_specific,Or maybe increased incubation time required
3775,3_technical,4_specific,"Separate counts for each fish, or did you total the time for each interaction/replicate?"
3776,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs in methods
3777,4_logic,3_general,You should have explored this at a greater detail by comparing other model organisms and indicating how these mechanisms treated with your inhibitors translate at a broader scale.
3778,3_technical,4_specific,You should also make a point in this figure about the increase in the strength of contraction with increments of the stimulation voltage
3779,4_logic,6_holistic,How does light affect energy allocation specifically? What specific changes in metabolism does light availability elicit?
3780,4_logic,4_specific,But why was testing sodium important?!
3781,3_technical,4_specific,Missing information about the used statistical test
3782,3_technical,4_specific,Comparing what specifically? Mean distance traveled towards each maybe? How did you assess this?
3783,3_technical,3_general,"Just for the next report, refer to the BioCore Resource Guide to format your in-text citations."
3784,2_writing,4_specific,This and the next sentence are “big picture” and would flow better toward the end of the discussion.
3785,3_technical,4_specific,These statements are more suitable for figure caption
3786,3_technical,4_specific,"Don’t use titles in figures, and you can shorten that y-axis"
3787,3_technical,8_nobasis,Comparing means?
3788,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
3789,3_technical,4_specific,What are your (in)dependent variables? What leafy green did you use and why?
3790,2_writing,4_specific,"You do not need to provide statistics or specific values in your abstract, although you do need to tie your findings back to the big picture"
3791,3_technical,6_holistic,This process also requires Ca++. What happen in the muscle after ACh binds the receptor?
3792,3_technical,3_general,This is the same information available in your figureds
3793,2_writing,4_specific,"Avoid roman numerals (they are too hard to read in most fonts). You can just use 1, 2, etc."
3794,3_technical,3_general,"Generally, only the p-value needs to be reported."
3795,2_writing,3_general,revise
3796,3_technical,3_general,"More powerful actually. Idk if that’s a statistical concept you’ve come across yet, but it basically means the number you get is less likely to be wrong"
3797,2_writing,1_pointer,typo?
3798,3_technical,6_holistic,So maybe we don’t have as robust a protocol for chloroplast extraction for kale as we do spinach?
3799,4_logic,4_specific,"Why did you think they molted together? That is something that you could measure, if you don’t have evidence for that, then avoid speculations."
3800,3_technical,4_specific,Try to just zoom in one one contraction rather than all of them
3801,2_writing,2_copyedit,You repeated this section in your results and discussion. I would definitely say it belongs in the discussion
3802,3_technical,2_copyedit,Wrong indication. Figure 1 is your reagent table.
3803,2_writing,2_copyedit,“Support” might be a better word
3804,3_technical,2_copyedit,Sterilize first! And include how you sterilized things.
3805,4_logic,6_holistic,"Your Discussion should include future implications of your current experiment, in addition to possible improvements. How does your experiment on Trifluoperzaine/Calmodulin/Physarum relate to mechanisms of other organisms? Board scale implications should have been indicated as concluding remarks and should have been reflected in Abstract accordingly."
3806,2_writing,1_pointer,grammar
3807,2_writing,2_copyedit,Did you mean hindrance?
3808,2_writing,2_copyedit,Muscle contractions?
3809,4_logic,4_specific,"Also, I’m a little confused about the reasoning you provided for looking at alkaline conditions because you’re talking about root uptake, but this experiment only looks at isolated chrloplasts."
3810,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Good job being concise here, but you have to say the p values in the text of the results section"
3811,3_technical,4_specific,Every other day? That is why you gave them 40 g in total.
3812,3_technical,2_copyedit,You need a figure reference here!
3813,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to summarize the data with just 2 columns and with error bars, instead of showing the raw data for all of the replicates"
3814,4_logic,6_holistic,"Wouldn’t low soil nutrients cause allocation to the roots, no the shoots?"
3815,2_writing,4_specific,You could say that the myograms have those three phases. That will link your previous sentence with this one.
3816,3_technical,4_specific,"So, percent change?"
3817,3_technical,4_specific,You don’t need to formally write out the independent and dependent variables. Just state what the different groups were fed
3818,3_technical,3_general,Where are the table legends? That is necessaryYou are missing the SD for those averages.
3819,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you also include means and SDs
3820,3_technical,4_specific,Is this the most concise way to communicate no significant difference?
3821,3_technical,4_specific,Which voltage? Output or input?
3822,3_technical,4_specific,I think this is a qualitative result of your experiment. So this information should e in the results also.
3823,3_technical,4_specific,Absorbance of what? What’s being absorbed? (This needs more context.)
3824,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Clarify this statement – I know what you’re trying to say, but you don’t quite get there. If you need to break this entire sentence up into 2, that’s ok!"
3825,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Good, remember no titlesAlso try to make this graph into 4 bars, where you average the controls and treatments for each leg and include error bars."
3826,4_logic,4_specific,"No need to talk about sources of error, since your data supported your hypothesis. Talk more about how color and aggression evolved independently, like you mentioned in the introduction section"
3827,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I would label the y-axis as twitch threshold (V), and just label the bars under as Control and Treatment."
3828,3_technical,4_specific,Add a sentence about why you used Rana pipiens as a subject
3829,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is unnecessary if you also include the citation at the end of the sentence
3830,2_writing,4_specific,"State your hypothesis first, then your methods, then a sentence about your results. You can then state your hypothesis was not supported and write a concluding sentence"
3831,3_technical,2_copyedit,Only the food was obtained from here
3832,3_technical,2_copyedit,Did all your controls reach the commitment pulse? Otherwise this isn’t super accurate
3833,3_technical,2_copyedit,Wrong indication. Figure 1 is your reagent table.

3835,3_technical,2_copyedit,Error bars
3836,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (basic criteria)
3837,4_logic,3_general,What about your hypothesis?!
3838,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
3839,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
3840,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is not a very scientific way of phrasing this
3841,3_technical,4_specific,Need to specify that you used the averages of each pot in the statistics
3842,2_writing,4_specific,No need to include specific quantities in the intro. You can save it for the methods.
3843,2_writing,2_copyedit,Looking at your p-value and your graph again. It would have been plausible for you to go the route of “We were approaching significance” and “but we didn’t have a large enough sample size.” As 0.0624 is very close to 0.05 and we can see a tremendous change between the control/experimental.
3844,3_technical,4_specific,Why this organism?
3845,4_logic,6_holistic,"Why does this give the new plant higher levels of success? I would argue that it means the parent plant has higher fitness, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that the offspring plants have higher success (however you define that)."
3846,2_writing,3_general,Methods should be all in past tense
3847,2_writing,3_general,this is ambiguous
3848,2_writing,4_specific,I would move this to the methods section
3849,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
3850,3_technical,4_specific,Refer to a specific figure or table that contains summarized numerical results to support that statement.

3852,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format
3853,3_technical,4_specific,This should be in paragraph form in your results
3854,3_technical,4_specific,You need to describe your error bars and provide the statistical values
3855,3_technical,2_copyedit,The standard deviation is not another important figure.
3856,3_technical,4_specific,"Your x-axis needs a label (with units), and shouldn’t say “Chart Title” at the top. Also, reiterate your statistical results in your figure caption."
3857,2_writing,4_specific,"State your actual hypothesis before you state the results, and then you can have a concluding sentence where you state that your hypothesis was not supported (don’t mention the null though)"
3858,2_writing,3_general,Wrong tense
3859,2_writing,2_copyedit,I recommended you avoid using the terms of treatment and control group because the same muscles were used for both conditions.
3860,2_writing,3_general,You need to keep your tenses consistent.
3861,3_technical,2_copyedit,Put stats in your caption
3862,4_logic,3_general,No need to discuss sources of error unless you have evidence that they actually affected your results
3863,3_technical,4_specific,"The standard deviation bars for this graph was not formatted properly and seems to have been made by excel’s default standard deviation error bars (They don’t work). If you need help with putting standard deviation bars, you can either email me to meet or take a look at the resource guide for instructions."
3864,3_technical,2_copyedit,T
3865,3_technical,3_general,"I need to know exactly what you did in your methods section – down to the volumes used (for everything), centrifuging parameters, etc"
3866,3_technical,4_specific,"Up to here it reads as if you only tested one pair of fish, can you be more specific? Can you also talk a bit more about your points system – how did you execute it in the lab? A one-tailed paired t-test will be more appropriate for your data. It accounts for the fact that you used the same groups of fish for both treatments. Re-run the test (results probably won’t change)"
3867,3_technical,4_specific,What mean?  You should include the means that are important to your discussion here in paragraph form.
3868,3_technical,4_specific,The standard deviations are the same for both groups in every single day
3869,3_technical,4_specific,This figure needs error bars and does not need a title
3870,2_writing,3_general,Methods should really be past-passive.
3871,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Since your table has the R:S mass and R:S length, you need to report p values for each dependent variable here. Also need to refer to the table/figure here"
3872,3_technical,2_copyedit,And the muscle
3873,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
3874,3_technical,3_general,table legends should describe the displayed information in the table. They should be self-explanatory
3875,2_writing,3_general,"I am not sure what this sentence means.Can you rephrase these first three sentences to make them more concrete and specific? You are trying to say a lot, but in actuality you aren’t really stating anything definitively"
3876,3_technical,3_general,Check the core resource guide for what goes into a figure caption.

3879,3_technical,2_copyedit,Table
3880,2_writing,2_copyedit,You can omit this
3881,3_technical,2_copyedit,I think you mean p-values. An alpha value is the significance level that you basically set as a cut off to determine significance (0.05 – as you mentioned earlier)
3882,4_logic,4_specific,How is weight tied to pupationg and 20E?
3883,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Where is your figure title (needs to be in the caption)? Also, what do the error bars represent?"
3884,3_technical,3_general,"Need to refer to the figures here, after you talk about each dependent variable"

3902,3_technical,4_specific,What was thrown out and what was recentrifuged during each step? Be more specific

3939,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can cite this as part of the lab manual (they were written by the same people).
3940,2_writing,4_specific,Just need to reorganize this a little but so it flows better.  Talk about the p-values when you bring up how the length and weight should react to increased JH.  Also include why increased JH would caused these results.
3941,3_technical,4_specific,What did you do again to measure twitch duration and relaxation period? The muscle was stimulated after the injection.

3984,4_logic,3_general,Why would you study this/broader impacts?
3985,2_writing,2_copyedit,Do not say “began this experiment”. Just start explaining what you did. Ex: Eight individuals of Manduca sexta with similar size and weight were used (if you want you can specify the values between parenthesis).

3987,3_technical,2_copyedit,Units?

3995,3_technical,4_specific,What did you average? Does that include the weight for every single day or is the average of the total change after a week?
3996,3_technical,4_specific,Why is this frog easy to use for this kind of study?
3997,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly). As such, this graph should have 16 standard deviation bars total"
3998,3_technical,4_specific,"What stat did you run? Also I’m confused about what exactly you are measuring? You only said that you found the min and max threshold of response for the leg, but what numbers did you collect?"
3999,3_technical,4_specific,"Where’s your other lit cited? And, where is the graph?"
4000,4_logic,3_general,"Good, now discuss future directions/implications for this experiment"
4001,2_writing,2_copyedit,"We never prove anything, no matter how hard we try…"
4002,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can just say “we used a two-sample t-test”
4003,3_technical,2_copyedit,They both had the same t-value? That’s pretty odd
4004,3_technical,1_pointer,?
4005,3_technical,4_specific,Reconsider the Title of the graph. This is not the amplitude of the threshold. You are showing the amplitude of contraction at the threshold stimulus.
4006,4_logic,3_general,Make sure you connect your findings to the big picture
4007,4_logic,4_specific,"Right, so since this study helps inform your hypothesis, it would be more useful if you explained it before you introduce your hypothesis and experiment. Providing that context will help support why you predicted what you did."
4008,3_technical,4_specific,Keep in mind that the myogram is just how you measure this. What are you actually affecting with the potassium blocker?
4009,3_technical,3_general,"where? Also about the table above, where is a legend for that? Can you put a better version of that table? Also include data/stat indicating major trends in your caption."
4010,2_writing,4_specific,Maybe have a sentence or two to use this to come up with a likely cellular mechanisms that accounts for your findings
4011,3_technical,2_copyedit,"The muscle wasn’t cut near the knee at all, it was cut at the other end (which end is that?)"
4012,2_writing,4_specific,"This needs to be a little bit longer, and should discuss the basics of muscle contraction"
4013,3_technical,2_copyedit,This needs to be in mL
4014,3_technical,2_copyedit,First sentence should be the title of the figure.
4015,3_technical,3_general,You need to have a citation in this section of the report. Citing the lab manual does not count unfortunately.
4016,4_logic,4_specific,Tie your results back to the big picture. What does this study tell us about intraspecific behavior?
4017,3_technical,2_copyedit,Treatment group?
4018,3_technical,4_specific,"Good figure, it would be best to add a simple bar graph of average difference in weight from the first to the last day (with error bars)"

4025,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Ha, ok it’s great that you’re excited but here just say whether your hypothesis was supported or not."
4026,4_logic,6_holistic,Need to give a little more background about why you would have chosen this experiment. Why would color affect aggression?

4029,3_technical,2_copyedit,You had a one-tailed hypothesis…
4030,3_technical,3_general,You need at least another source
4031,2_writing,4_specific,Include highlights from Discussion
4032,3_technical,4_specific,I don’t understand this idea. The 0.05 is the p-value for statistical significance.
4033,4_logic,4_specific,"Why? Again, you need to specifically state what changes with partial light spectrum."
4034,4_logic,4_specific,"But in the intro, you said that it wasn’t."
4035,2_writing,2_copyedit,hypothesis
4036,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not necessary
4037,1_basic,3_general,Your introduction needs primary literature from a scientific journal
4038,3_technical,2_copyedit,"It is just a paired t-test, not a two sample paired t-test"
4039,4_logic,4_specific,"Do you think this really made a difference? Couldn’t you have just re-marked them, or determined the junction visually?"
4040,2_writing,4_specific,This is a result. Should not be in this section.
4041,3_technical,3_general,Where are your primary literature citations? You need these in the intro AND discussion.
4042,3_technical,4_specific,"So, higher concentration of saline  less photosynthesis than the lower concentration?"
4043,3_technical,2_copyedit,Should mention that your used %change formula to convert your raw absorbance data
4044,3_technical,4_specific,"Be more specific about what you mean here, what is the exact thing you are measuring?"
4045,3_technical,4_specific,Does this mean response? If so at what voltage?  For both legs control and treatment?
4046,3_technical,4_specific,It is also released at higher levels before each molt during the larval phase.
4047,4_logic,4_specific,"If your results are not significant, is this really true?"
4048,4_logic,6_holistic,"Are you interested in murky water because it is toxic, or because it decreases water visibility? I think this is an OK study to cite, because it talks about agonistic behavior, but it doesn’t really support your hypothesis. Consider finding another journal article on water visibility, or even fish vision, to support your hypothesis."
4049,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This is confusing, do you mean the p-value is 4.11 or the t-stat?"
4050,3_technical,2_copyedit,report stat values
4051,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Remember, you need stats and a description of error bars in your figure captions"
4052,2_writing,4_specific,"This is a little too much detail for the title. As long as you have it in your introduction, I would consider leaving this out."
4053,3_technical,2_copyedit,State what these averages are (+/- a standard deviation)
4054,3_technical,4_specific,Incorrect interpretation here. The stats weren’t significant
4055,2_writing,3_general,Look out for proofreading errors
4056,3_technical,4_specific,"You also don’t need a figure with your statistical results, as you state them in the results section. Keep your one graph (but take away the title – that’s what figure captions are for), try and change the graph so all controls are the same color and all treatments are the same color, so have a more clear legend that breaks down which individuals are control and treatment)"
4057,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Johnson, 2018"
4058,3_technical,4_specific,Average of the weight differences or the actual values? It is a little unclear
4059,2_writing,4_specific,Add a final concluding sentence about what happened biologically (basically sum up your discussion in a short sentence)
4060,4_logic,2_copyedit,Here would be a great place to mention artificial selection

4066,2_writing,3_general,This sentence has a few errors in it – please proofread your paper before you hand it in.
4067,3_technical,3_general,Figure captions are not your results section. It is a separate section summarizing your results and statistics
4068,2_writing,3_general,This looks more like an antecedent than a concluding remark.
4069,2_writing,3_general,"We never prove things, no matter how hard we try…"
4070,2_writing,4_specific,Better choice of words would be “do not significantly change” or something similar.
4071,3_technical,3_general,Do not use website URLs on primary sources
4072,3_technical,2_copyedit,Should have mentioned that you used %change formula to convert your raw absorbance data

4074,2_writing,4_specific,"Be concise, just say in four caterpillars"
4075,1_basic,3_general,"This introduction is too brief and (more importantly) lacks any sort of primary literature citations. You need to cite your sources in the text where you use their information, not just at the end."
4076,3_technical,6_holistic,"RedactionThis is written like an explanation of the result. To include it in this section, you need to write this like an observation of the experiment."
4077,3_technical,4_specific,"Standard deviation, right? standard error is different.I’m confused about what this graph is showing, it doesn’t match what you told me in the methods. How did you get multiple scores in each type of water for each fish? Please clarify, or include a different graph if this doesn’t accurately display what you did."
4078,3_technical,3_general,Use citation style in the lab resource guide/like was on the resource guide quiz.
4079,2_writing,4_specific,You could actually get rid of this line. In abstract it is implied that you have both control and treatment groups.

4081,3_technical,4_specific,"Only length and weight, or do you mean ratios?"

4083,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not a technical term. Try “twitching”
4084,4_logic,3_general,"A lot of this information leading up to this was more results and observations. I need to see interpretation of why you think you got these results, go into the biology of it, talk about previous studies that saw similar or dissimilar things"

4090,1_basic,4_specific,"You should mention your p-value in the results, even though you will wait to talk about what its significance actually means until the discussion"
4091,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report your standard deviations whenever you report averages. 1.30 +/- sd.
4092,3_technical,4_specific,Why? Give some background on enzyme functionality.
4093,3_technical,6_holistic,"Is all of this needed? Are you planning to talk about weights and lengths, or just the ratios?"
4094,3_technical,4_specific,I’m not sure why I didn’t point this out in the submission but I would have displayed this as a bar graph after averaging the amplitudes for the controls as well as the treatments. (So 2 graphs with 2 bars on each showing control amplitude vs treatment amplitude and control threshold vs. treatment threshold.)
4095,4_logic,3_general,"Your discussion needs a lot of work as well, you need to talk about what all these effects have, your experiment and the primary literature. How are they related, what can this do for science going forward, etc"

4100,3_technical,2_copyedit,You won’t need to create a justification for your statistical test
4101,2_writing,4_specific,This should be in the results section and not the methods
4102,3_technical,3_general,Act as if you did the experiment on all four
4103,4_logic,3_general,You need to talk about their explanation for these data. You also need to wrap up your discussion with an explanatory sentence
4104,2_writing,4_specific,"Careful in the future about getting too methody, this is right on the edge, keep it kind of vague in the intro"
4105,4_logic,4_specific,Not necessarily—what about climate change?!
4106,4_logic,4_specific,What aspect of tubocurarine would you change?The amount delivered or the concentration?
4107,3_technical,4_specific,So is your p-value significant or not?
4108,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You don’t say the entire title of the figure, just say figure 1"
4109,3_technical,4_specific,"These graphs would be better with 2 bars, with the overall means, instead of the means of each “trial”"
4110,2_writing,3_general,Can you think of a more descriptive title?
4111,3_technical,4_specific,This needs a citation
4112,3_technical,4_specific,This should not go here in a separate sentence. If you want to include it just write with the mean.
4113,2_writing,4_specific,Have an intro sentence or two explain briefly about contractions and how sodium plays a role in them
4114,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
4115,3_technical,4_specific,This graph is shown with more detail by the line graph below so this graph is not needed.
4116,4_logic,4_specific,"The fact that your hypothesis was not supported, does not mean you did it wrong. So don’t assume that you made mistakes and those are causing your results. I actually don’t believe those were errors in your experiment. Possible explanation: think about the doses of IGR that you gave the animal. 6 drops of IGR is only 0.3 mL for every 50 mL of food. That is a very low doses."
4117,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars. As such, this graph should have 14 standard deviation bars total."
4118,3_technical,4_specific,"As figure 3 already displays this data, I would exclude table 1 and table 2."
4119,1_basic,4_specific,This is a possible explanation of the results. That is not part of this section. That goes in the Discussion
4120,3_technical,3_general,Citations are required in this section

4126,4_logic,4_specific,First focus on providing a biological explanation for why the manipulation you made produced the results you observed.
4127,3_technical,3_general,"In the future, this graph would be more clear if you put each dependent variable on it’s own graph. You’ve grouped it together by treatment here instead of by dependent variable."
4128,4_logic,4_specific,"I would put this first. This goes back to your hypothesis. Order-wise, I think it makes more sense to say, we expect movement toward calcium in both, but to a great extent with the activator."
4129,2_writing,3_general,revise
4130,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Don’t use a title, missing y-axis label"

4132,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
4133,2_writing,2_copyedit,This kind of seems like “the ends justify the means.” You could simply just say no major errors were noted.
4134,3_technical,4_specific,"Switch these columns so the control appears first, because that’s what you measured first."
4135,3_technical,4_specific,Well you’re not measuring weight. Voltage values?
4136,2_writing,4_specific,"Read back through this intro because the flow is a little all over the place, you need to explain all the information and then arrive at your hypothesis"
4137,3_technical,4_specific,just present the data with the outlier removed since you already justified it in the method
4138,3_technical,4_specific,What part of the photosynthetic process does temperature and herbicide affect?
4139,3_technical,6_holistic,I would show this as a graph as graphs are easier to visualize.
4140,3_technical,3_general,There are no statistics here
4141,3_technical,4_specific,The maximum voltage? Are you sure?
4142,2_writing,4_specific,"This counts as interpretation, and should go in the discussion section"

4147,2_writing,3_general,"You need to work a little on fleshing out your intro, walk through all the connections between hormones, insects, azadirachtin, weight/pupation and your hypothesis."
4148,3_technical,4_specific,As the same leg served as both the control and the experimental I would use a paired t-test rather than a two sample t-test
4149,2_writing,4_specific,You could actually get rid of this line. In abstract it is implied that you have both control and treatment groups.

4248,3_technical,4_specific,"You don’t need a title here, and the legend is a bit messy. Can you get all controls one color and all treatments another?"
4249,3_technical,2_copyedit,Your hypothesis is one-tailed…
4250,3_technical,2_copyedit,0.05
4251,3_technical,2_copyedit,Figure legend doesn’t match with Figure numbers posted above. You provided two reagent tables. Include your t-test results indicating significant results.
4252,3_technical,4_specific,"Check the units of y-axis. V or mV. I am just surprised that it only changed 0.4mV, that is too small! I think your measurements are in V"
4253,3_technical,2_copyedit,At roughly 27C
4254,1_basic,4_specific,You have to have references in the discussion section
4255,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Should be percent, not Molar"
4256,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You only need to report the p-value for the ANOVA, and you only need to report it once. Say something like, “There was a significant difference in red mane response time among the three groups (p=), and the Tukey Kramer test shows that X and Y groups and Y and Z groups were significantly different from each other."
4257,3_technical,4_specific,"Check your axesx-axis: there were not control frogs. The same muscle was used for both conditions, control and treatment. Write the axis in correspondence to that. Can you be more specific for the y-axis? Amplitude of contraction"
4258,2_writing,4_specific,Maybe give a little definition of chemotaxis? Just a suggestion.
4259,3_technical,2_copyedit,"To make this section more concise, just say “x was not greater than y (figure 1)” instead of listing the means and standard deviations in the text. Make sure you refer to the figures"
4260,3_technical,4_specific,You cant do this.  You can only compare frog one with frog one.
4261,3_technical,3_general,You omit standard deviations from your results and you spend too much time in your discussion explaining p-values (you can assume that your reader can interpret significance without saying that the p-value was higher than the critical value).
4262,2_writing,4_specific,You never really explain the concept of allocation in this intro
4263,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t refer people to other sections like this.
4264,2_writing,4_specific,This would belong in the results section
4265,3_technical,2_copyedit,State the figure #
4266,3_technical,2_copyedit,No reference to Figure 3?
4267,3_technical,2_copyedit,Be sure to reference your graphs somewhere in this section
4268,3_technical,3_general,You don’t need to go into methods as much in figure captions
4269,4_logic,1_pointer,?
4270,2_writing,2_copyedit,Nothing is every proven in this lab but hypothesis can be supported.
4271,3_technical,4_specific,"Just say that it’s significant and save explanations for the discussion. Also, if you have graphs, reference them in your results."
4272,3_technical,3_general,Revise with correct indication of figures
4273,3_technical,2_copyedit,Two-sample
4274,3_technical,4_specific,What stats did you intend upon doing?
4275,3_technical,4_specific,"To beef this up a little, you can talk about why the Manduca is helpful to study"
4276,2_writing,4_specific,Give some indication of the results here. Does/does not affect
4277,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I would not put it this way. You can rather say that, although our experiment showed statistically insignificant result, a previous study…”"
4278,4_logic,4_specific,You need to include a sentence that explains the role of color perception in aggression to connect the dots.
4279,2_writing,4_specific,You still need a hypothesis in your abstract
4280,3_technical,6_holistic,Can you tell me about what this physiological salt concentration looks like near the light-dependent reaction site?
4281,3_technical,2_copyedit,What we labeled the tubes isn’t important
4282,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t use quotations, just paraphrase what the paper said."
4283,3_technical,4_specific,"Rework how these are written, average 1.155 +/- 0.92. And make it consistent, average than standard dev"
4284,3_technical,3_general,Graphs look good. Need to have more detail in the figure legends though
4285,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report as mean +/- standard deviation
4286,2_writing,2_copyedit,This seems a little unnecessary
4287,2_writing,3_general,Don’t need this. Sounds colloquial
4288,3_technical,4_specific,"Use standard error, not standard deviation. Standard error is standard deviation divided by the square root of sample size"
4289,2_writing,3_general,This title can still be condensed but isn’t a problem here
4290,3_technical,4_specific,Can you define this variable? Specify what did you consider a threshold value
4291,4_logic,4_specific,"Your intro is good thus far, but now that the reader understands resource allocation, what can you tell us about how light might affect resource allocation? You need to make the connection between root/shoot growth in response to stimuli and light availability before introducing your hypothesis."
4292,2_writing,3_general,I’m still confused by this statement
4293,3_technical,3_general,"Good job w/ moving your R2 values to the results section, but this kind of interpretation stuff belongs in the discussion section"
4294,3_technical,2_copyedit,This should be explicit in the figure legend or the graph
4295,4_logic,4_specific,What did this study do? What did they find? Is it related to yours?
4296,2_writing,2_copyedit,Supported might be a better word choice
4297,2_writing,2_copyedit,put in parenthesis
4298,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I like the idea of these graphs, however it’s hard to look for differences between control and treatment groups when they are on two separate graphs. One graph that displays overall difference in weight would be easier to read"
4299,2_writing,6_holistic,Don’t preface what you’re going to say with an intro explicitly stating what you’re going to say. You can just say it. Look out for these throughout your report.
4300,2_writing,4_specific,I would move this to the methods section
4301,2_writing,3_general,"Is this relevant to your question? Generally, I suggest that you increase the focus on the effects of light/shade on plant resource allocation in this introduction before introducing your hypothesis. Are there studies on this topic done on other plants?"
4302,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If consecutive sentences use the same citation, you can cite it at the end of the last sentence"
4303,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
4304,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
4305,2_writing,3_general,Colloquial languge
4306,4_logic,3_general,How is this related to your own experiment?
4307,2_writing,3_general,This is irrelevant information for your study. Make sure you start with the big picture
4308,3_technical,8_nobasis,Was it?
4309,3_technical,4_specific,Need to specify the intermediate calculations. You used the averages of each pot in statistics
4310,3_technical,4_specific,What’s GE? Capitalize your y-axis.
4311,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? How does food presence relate to aggression? You need to connect the dots for your reader.
4312,3_technical,2_copyedit,Add a zero in front of your decimals “0.8%”
4313,3_technical,4_specific,"Here, you could give that Kucerik reference again"
4314,1_basic,3_general,This report will have to receive a 1/4 since it’s not done yet. But you can correct it for the 2nd submission
4315,2_writing,4_specific,You need to start your introduction by explaining the relevant biological concepts; betta fish are only a model through which to understand aggression.
4316,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format is [last name : year]
4317,3_technical,4_specific,Why do you say it wasn’t properly injected?
4318,3_technical,4_specific,The threshold value is a result of the experiment
4319,4_logic,6_holistic,"You don’t always need an alternate explanation. However, do you think it might also be the case that the addition of JH may have made the food less palatable for the Manduca?"
4320,4_logic,3_general,state your hypothesis more clearly indicating what you expect to see in photosynthesis activity
4321,4_logic,3_general,The discussion should connect your results to other scientific literature. The one citation you have (for something that is not really primary literature) is not enough!
4322,3_technical,4_specific,"but none of your caterpillars pupated. Trust me, you’d know!"
4323,2_writing,6_holistic,"Good job on having the methods section concisely in the abstract. Although, you may want to remove the measurements as it’s more important to let the readers know it was precor vs water than for them to know the exact amount in the abstract."
4324,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not necessary
4325,2_writing,2_copyedit,this reads like an instruction not a statement in the method
4326,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Correct format: Correct format for reporting: t-stat=_, d.f.=_, P=_ Refer to Bio Resource Guide for more details."
4327,3_technical,2_copyedit,Good figure. Include the stats reuslts in your figure caption.Figure 1:  not Graph 1:
4328,2_writing,4_specific,Try to include your hypothesis as well as a sentence or 2 about calcium’s role in normal muscle contraction.
4329,2_writing,2_copyedit,"You already mention this as a result, so do not repeat it again. Just tell your idea without stating the result again."
4330,4_logic,4_specific,Need to discuss why size would or wouldn’t have an effect on aggression
4331,1_basic,3_general,"You are missing an entire section, the Abstract. Don’t forget to include that because missing a section will lead to fail this evaluation."

4333,2_writing,2_copyedit,in Physarum
4334,3_technical,3_general,Where are your citations? You need primary literature in both into AND discussion
4335,3_technical,4_specific,Citation?

4339,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Correct format: Correct format for reporting: t-stat=_, d.f.=_, P=_ Refer to Bio Resource Guide for more details."
4340,3_technical,2_copyedit,This would be 70µL as 10µL per drop
4341,4_logic,6_holistic,"This is good, but what about the chloroplasts specifically would make excess NaCl toxic?"
4342,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should not have a title in the body of the figure. Your caption needs to have statistics and a description of error bars.
4343,1_basic,4_specific,This is an interpretation and should be in the discussion
4344,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Once again, you need statistics to state this"
4345,3_technical,2_copyedit,[last name : year]
4346,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include table of ANOVA and post hoc test results
4347,3_technical,4_specific,"Rather than a table, I would show this data in a graph as the reader would be less interested in the exact number vs the difference in growth. As such, I would recommend a bar graph showing the total average change in mass for the control and the experimental (along with standard deviation bars)."
4348,3_technical,4_specific,"Probably you can omit this table, because it only contains one value, so you can mention it in the results section."
4349,3_technical,4_specific,Try to mention the setup itself.
4350,2_writing,4_specific,This needs to be in your methods
4351,3_technical,4_specific,What we numbered our tubes is not important. Describe the separation of treatments without the numbering
4352,3_technical,2_copyedit,Do not need figure titles
4353,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Report p-value, not t-value"

4356,3_technical,4_specific,Why is this a helpful organism to study hormone regulation in?
4357,3_technical,2_copyedit,Order sources in the same order you first cited them in the paper

4359,3_technical,4_specific,"Units on y-axis, check your error bars"
4360,2_writing,4_specific,"This introduction needs some more information. Some things to include would be background on the species of interest, how muscle contractions normally work, and what Ach normally"
4361,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the y-axisAmplitude of contraction (V)
4362,4_logic,4_specific,"I don’t see the relation between the components of this hypothesis. The “if” and “then” portions could be related better. The prediction here is valid without the injection of caffeine, so the effect of caffeine is not clear."
4363,2_writing,6_holistic,Informal. Use your best judgement to locate all the informal/colloquial terms/texts/formats used in this report and revise accordingly.
4364,2_writing,2_copyedit,You’ve already stated this multiple times; try to limit the redundancies.
4365,3_technical,4_specific,Can you specify the used voltage to generate those contractions?
4366,3_technical,4_specific,"This observation could go in the results, although it is okay here in the discussion."
4367,3_technical,4_specific,"As the same legs were used as the control and the experimental, I would recommend a paired t-test instead."
4368,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
4369,3_technical,2_copyedit,Improperly formatted error bars
4370,3_technical,8_nobasis,What do you mean?
4371,2_writing,4_specific,"This background info should be one of the first things you say. Introduce chlorophyll and chloroplasts, how they absorb light energy, then how the light-dependent reaction carries out."
4372,3_technical,4_specific,You are missing the statistical analysis. That should be included in the methods.
4373,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I didn’t mention this last time, but try to nix titles for figures and use them only for tables going forward!"
4374,2_writing,3_general,"This abstract needs a little work. Think two sentences of intro, hypothesis, one sentence for methods, two for results, and one short concluding sentence."
4375,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure to include what statistical test you used.
4376,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include a some results values and the statistics
4377,2_writing,3_general,"Title needs some work, make it concise"
4378,4_logic,3_general,You need to tie your findings back to the big picture
4379,3_technical,3_general,Reference the figures in the results

4383,2_writing,3_general,I’m still confused what this means?
4384,3_technical,2_copyedit,Great Leaks Manduca (GLM) diet
4385,3_technical,4_specific,Didn’t you say the –value was 0.256 in the results section?
4386,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can list average and standard dev together by writing 2.75 +/- .3185 g
4387,3_technical,4_specific,should have mentioned about chloroplast isolation procedure and how it could have affected the treatment and control groups.
4388,2_writing,4_specific,"I’d focus on reorganizing this and really figuring out what is important to include. I’d recommend introducing DCPIP, and trying how it works to your biological background information. Why’d you use mustard greens?"
4389,2_writing,1_pointer,Spelling mistake
4390,3_technical,3_general,Can you make it larger?
4391,2_writing,2_copyedit,From where?

4401,2_writing,2_copyedit,Figure 2:
4402,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would just leave this as “Was not significantly different” as the word “significant” carries a statistical meaning and implies that it could have been due to chance.
4403,3_technical,4_specific,This is a lot of information and would be best shown in a table.
4404,3_technical,4_specific,"After the class explanation, try doing one t-test for all the data.  Let me know if you need help."
4405,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Choose one to include,  not both."
4406,3_technical,4_specific,This is not necessary because you already mentioned that each leg received the same treatment.
4407,3_technical,2_copyedit,Are these averaged values? Where are the SD?
4408,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I’m not sure if allows is the correct word here, but this is a science class, not an English class"

4419,4_logic,6_holistic,Are there other studies that have examined resource allocation in different types of substrates?
4420,4_logic,6_holistic,You can test this with your data – were the saline plants smaller than the control plants?
4421,2_writing,4_specific,remove or more this sentence elsewhere. You should begin more broadly
4422,3_technical,2_copyedit,Also state your t-statistic
4423,2_writing,6_holistic,You could probably find if this is true in the literature somewhere
4424,2_writing,4_specific,You could actually get rid of this line. In abstract it is implied that you have both control and treatment groups.
4425,3_technical,4_specific,"Did you convert those values for the analysis? Then, probably this is not affecting your data too much. I agree this was an error in the measurement procedure, but probably it does not explain the results. What do you think about the used doses? It might be low"
4426,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Four, you are missing the egg phase"
4427,3_technical,4_specific,"Same idea than before. You need to describe the result. Look the figure, and describe what you can see there"
4428,3_technical,6_holistic,"Martin’s IGR is also different from the JH that Manduca makes (think back to the case study where floss flower didn’t make actual JH). As such, you should note that Martin’s IGR is a JH analogue rather than JH itself."

4430,4_logic,3_general,Connect your findings back to the big picture
4431,3_technical,2_copyedit,Wait. Where’s this data?

4433,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Lastly, can you just shorten that x-axis so day 8 doesn’t show, since there’s no data there?"
4434,2_writing,2_copyedit,You don’t need this
4435,4_logic,3_general,"Use your primary resources to back up what you’re saying. They are meant to support your claims, so elaborate on them more"
4436,3_technical,4_specific,Also introduce statistical tests you performed to analyze the data
4437,4_logic,3_general,"This should be written as a suggestion or a possible explanation, not like a result."
4438,3_technical,2_copyedit,Your averages should also include standard deviations
4439,4_logic,3_general,You need to actually discuss this experiment
4440,2_writing,4_specific,You don’t need to give all this details about the methods in the Abstract. That is fine for the methods section.
4441,2_writing,4_specific,“Herbicide treatment” or when treated with herbicide. Go through results and discussion sections to make necessary editing in order to convey the message in a much clearer way.

4444,2_writing,2_copyedit,"If this is your hypothesis, say “We hypothesize that…” or “Our hypothesis is…”"
4445,3_technical,4_specific,This is the only time you ever mention other legs. Combine all this data into one graph otherwise it’s a little confusing.
4446,2_writing,3_general,Methods should be written in past tense.
4447,4_logic,3_general,"Don’t discuss sources of error unless you have evidence that they actually affected your data. Instead, maybe mung beans aren’t affected by wavelength? Think of biological explanations"
4448,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should include the statistics values your got form your t-test at the end of this caption. Also include the magnitude of your s.d. error bars.
4449,3_technical,3_general,"These are still raw data, which I explicitly mentioned to remove"
4450,4_logic,4_specific,I don’t see your point here. The hypothesis was supported!
4451,2_writing,4_specific,This is verging on methods
4452,3_technical,2_copyedit,Having just one standard deviation value for two sets of data doesn’t make sense numerically.
4453,2_writing,4_specific,"Separate your sources or find more – compare studies, use them to back up what you’re saying. This should be your bottom half of your hour glass"

4455,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You don’t need to report the SD, it is shown in the figure. You do need to provide stats"
4456,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Report means ± standard deviations, as I showed in class. Two sig figs is enough."

4458,2_writing,6_holistic,"Is this the most important conclusion form your experiment? Does it explain the results? Then, why include it in the Abstract?"
4459,2_writing,4_specific,This all belongs in the discussion.

4478,2_writing,4_specific,"This should be in the discussion because you are making a claim based on the results. So, say this in the discussion, but also keep this in the results section just without the reasoning."
4479,3_technical,2_copyedit,We typically use 0.05 in biology. So be clear which significance level you’re using

4483,3_technical,2_copyedit,What year was this article published?
4484,3_technical,4_specific,Which t-test did you use? Two-sample vs paired t-test
4485,2_writing,3_general,Write these in a more concise manner
4486,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is awkward.

4592,3_technical,2_copyedit,Just mention the conclusion of the experiment
4593,3_technical,2_copyedit,I think you may have found the standard deviation among your averages rather than among the raw values used to create those averages. The standard deviation should be different among each of the bars.

4647,3_technical,4_specific,"Main problem, you are saying what you did, like in the methods. That is not part of the discussion. Just focus on mentioning the obtained result and trying to explain that with the effect of lidocaine on Na+ channels and how this is influencing the contractionCitations are needed in this section"
4648,2_writing,6_holistic,"Then why did you hypothesize what you did?  This makes it seem as though the literature contradicts your hypothesis; I know that’s not the case, but find a way to reword this."
4649,3_technical,4_specific,This is not correct. The statistical data is not unreliable. The fact that you don’t have statistical significance it does not mean that data were unreliable.
4650,2_writing,6_holistic,This can go in the intro—we want as succinct an abstract as possible.

4961,3_technical,1_pointer,?
4962,3_technical,2_copyedit,Two-sample
4963,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t use this word unless you’re talking about statistics
4964,3_technical,4_specific,"You should support this with the values and the figures. Do not say, those were additional legs, just combine this with your results."
4965,3_technical,4_specific,Check your axisy-axis: you can be more specific than just time. What is the variable that you are showing here?x-axis is not quite right. Are you showing reaction time in that axis? No
4966,3_technical,4_specific,This is not quite right. Check in your lab manual how are the levels of JH before and after the commitment pulse.
4967,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data
4968,3_technical,4_specific,"I am confused, how did you get a p-value for the control group and another p-value for the experimental group? Reconsider your analysis, you compared each variable between control and experimental condition, so you can only have one p-value per comparison."
4969,3_technical,2_copyedit,Compared to control
4970,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (Basic criteria)
4971,2_writing,4_specific,Much of this could go in the results section
4972,3_technical,4_specific,Analyzing data for each leg independently leads to pseudo-replication. Compare control vs treatment groups and not legs.
4973,3_technical,4_specific,"How is this information different than the figures? Do not repeat information.Standard errors for the means for every dayIf you reported the SD per group, then you also should report the mean per group."
4974,3_technical,2_copyedit,Azamax is the brand and the chemical in it is azadirachtin
4975,4_logic,3_general,Provide biological reasoning behind your expectation
4976,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is kind of a weird sentence to end on..maybe say when given the inhibitor there is no significant effect on contraction
4977,3_technical,4_specific,You only need to say what statistical test was used.
4978,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence seems incomplete
4979,2_writing,4_specific,You are missing information about the obtained results. The Abstract should include information from all the sections.
4980,3_technical,4_specific,"This is interesting but is summed up in your other figure better, so this figure is not needed."
4981,4_logic,2_copyedit,"this is not a future research project, it is an experiment that you already did."
4982,4_logic,4_specific,"Be careful with interpretation here. Since the stats weren’t significant, you have to conclude that salt did not affect the weight ratio"
4983,4_logic,3_general,Why does this make sense or not? What did this person do in their experiment and how is it related?
4984,3_technical,2_copyedit,Where are references to figures 1 + 2?
4985,3_technical,3_general,Do something similar to what I did for this figures captions
4986,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you explicitly say whether your results were significantly different.
4987,3_technical,4_specific,"These captions need more in them. A legend in sentence form, what the error bars mean, and the stats associated with the figure"
4988,2_writing,4_specific,Avoid using questions unless it is a research question nested under your hypothesis
4989,3_technical,4_specific,which molecules?
4990,2_writing,4_specific,Should have included highlights from the discussion section as concluding lines.
4991,3_technical,2_copyedit,Eight because they were placed in four container.
4992,3_technical,3_general,These are not written like interpretations of the results
4993,2_writing,4_specific,"Include an introductory sentence or two , and mention the specific species, muscle, and chemical you are working with"
4994,2_writing,3_general,The first few sentences are a little unclear.
4995,4_logic,4_specific,"Be careful with interpretation. Since the stats weren’t significant, you have to conclude that there was no difference, even if the “graphs suggests” a difference"
4996,3_technical,4_specific,You should use a paired t-test
4997,2_writing,3_general,No quotes!
4998,3_technical,4_specific,What about the overall trend?
4999,3_technical,4_specific,What is the connection or citation for this statement?
5000,4_logic,3_general,This discussion is much too brief and needs more analysis of your results and also connections to other research in this field.
5001,3_technical,4_specific,You should run a paired t-test
5002,3_technical,3_general,"In the future when creating and labelling figures, try and have the order you mention the figures be the same order in which you number them"
5003,3_technical,4_specific,You should include these with averages for each group
5004,2_writing,4_specific,Maybe put this later than the overall background you start talking about in the next couple sentences
5005,4_logic,3_general,According to what?
5006,2_writing,4_specific,"This was your prediction, and you should mention it like that. Instead I would mention the effect of caffeine in the relaxation process of the muscle first and then state your prediction."
5007,2_writing,2_copyedit,decrease in contrast
5008,2_writing,2_copyedit,These two sentence can go. Just start with talking about the frog.
5009,3_technical,4_specific,I would rather focus on improving the procedure to isolate the chloroplast rather than doing 30 replicate per treatment
5010,3_technical,3_general,I can’t replicate this.
5011,3_technical,4_specific,"Your figure 1 and 2 basically state the same thing, so I would just stick with one of them. I like figure 1 a bit better"
5012,3_technical,2_copyedit,What is the dilution of the azamax solution
5013,2_writing,2_copyedit,line
5014,3_technical,2_copyedit,remove (Protocol steps in list)
5015,3_technical,2_copyedit,Insert the number of total legs you used in your results (i.e. four)
5016,3_technical,2_copyedit,What units are all these numbers?
5017,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars. As such, this graph should have 16 standard deviation bars total."
5018,3_technical,4_specific,Did you run the ANOVA on this as well? Need p-value…
5019,3_technical,4_specific,"Commented above.What specific data (the values you put in) is not significant?  You said it had tetany every time, that should be significant so what ever data you put into the t-test wasn’t (tetany vs not tetany).  Let me know if you are confused."
5020,3_technical,2_copyedit,How was it obtained and stored
5021,2_writing,2_copyedit,hypothesize
5022,2_writing,3_general,Remove and end more broad
5023,4_logic,4_specific,"Be careful with this interpretation. Since the stats weren’t significant, you can’t conclude that there was a difference between your 2 groups"
5024,3_technical,4_specific,How did you summarize the data?
5025,2_writing,3_general,revise
5026,3_technical,4_specific,"don’t report avg. distances, this is more suitable as a supplement. Try to find a pattern and indicate accordingly."
5027,3_technical,3_general,Please refer to the BioCore Resource Guide for in-text citations.
5028,3_technical,4_specific,Describe the authentic and inauthentic fake fish. These terms alone don’t really tell me anything about what the fish actually were presented with in their tanks.
5029,3_technical,2_copyedit,include d.f. value.
5030,3_technical,4_specific,Be specific here. How much grinding buffer did you use? How many spinach leaves did you use?
5031,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Once again, make sure this says contraction amplitude"
5032,3_technical,4_specific,"Definitely clarify that this is based only on observation – it’s difficult to draw much information from this since you had such a small sample size, but OK to note it as an interesting thing that you saw."
5033,3_technical,4_specific,What test did you run? Try to trim down these methods by cutting some of the unnecessary information
5034,3_technical,2_copyedit,I’d go ahead and refer to this figure in your methods section.
5035,3_technical,4_specific,Where is the statistical result to support this statement? Statistics should be reported in the results.
5036,2_writing,4_specific,Give some indication of the results…does/does not affect
5037,3_technical,4_specific,You should mention at the end of Methods section that you conducted a paired t-test to analyze your data. Do not introduce your stat test in result. Introduce what type to statistical tests you conducted in methods section and move on to stating their results in the results section.
5038,3_technical,4_specific,You don’t need to justify your results in the figure caption
5039,3_technical,4_specific,Indicate your critical value for p to determine significance
5040,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I don’t get this sentence or the previous one, so you only had two replicates? Clarify these or remove."
5041,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you include the year
5042,3_technical,4_specific,This intro needs a sentence (or more) about your experimental subject Rana pipiens and why you used it.
5043,3_technical,4_specific,"While not technically wrong, these tables are not helpful and there is little reason to include them since what they show could be better illustrated in a graph."
5044,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Using excel, we performed a …."
5045,3_technical,4_specific,"Because the same legs served as both your control and experimental, I would recommend a paired t-test."
5046,3_technical,4_specific,Specify what kind of equation it is and how it relevant. Should have mentioned that you used it to convert your raw data
5047,3_technical,2_copyedit,cationic
5048,2_writing,4_specific,Write the scientific question more clearly. Right now it is confusing.
5049,3_technical,4_specific,I would rather focus on improving the procedure to isolate the chloroplast rather than doing 30 replicate per treatment
5050,2_writing,2_copyedit,You can just call it “our hypothesis”
5051,3_technical,2_copyedit,By specific I meant adding grastrocnemius muscle or rana pipiens
5052,3_technical,4_specific,"There are several articles on this site. Which one is referenced, who authored it, when and where was it published?"
5053,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, maybe it did grow toward food at the beginning but changed direction later.. the traces could actually be revealed against a light source.."
5054,3_technical,4_specific,What data did you run the t-test on?
5055,3_technical,2_copyedit,+/- SD?
5056,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Third, since you have pictures of your setup, they should be referenced somewhere in the paper (generally in the methods section)"
5057,3_technical,2_copyedit,Axis labels are really small. Try enlarging them to make reading the graph easier. Also try to have a legend with colors rather than words.
5058,2_writing,8_nobasis,What does this mean?
5059,3_technical,2_copyedit,Round the numbers and include units
5060,3_technical,4_specific,No need to include the dilution in the intro. Save it for the methods.
5061,3_technical,4_specific,1x to 20x. provide dilution calc details
5062,2_writing,2_copyedit,No citations in the abstract.  Just say a previous study found that…
5063,3_technical,4_specific,Did you test both?
5064,1_basic,4_specific,"Your results section shouldn’t mention your hypotheses anywhere. What you can state is the general trend of your results, reference your figure, then state your p-value and whether it is significant or not."
5065,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what speed? For how long? I need to be able to replicate this experiment to validate your results!!11!
5066,3_technical,4_specific,Define group 1 and group 2
5067,3_technical,2_copyedit,What about statisitics?
5068,2_writing,2_copyedit,Coloration of the larvae
5069,3_technical,4_specific,"When you say force of contraction, do you mean contraction amplitude? Because Force is in Newtons, and amplitude is in Volts, so they are different things"
5070,3_technical,4_specific,I would generalize the trend as this can be seen as raw data in some instances.
5071,2_writing,2_copyedit,?
5072,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I would not put it this way. You can rather say that, although our experiment showed statistically insignificant result, a previous study…”"
5073,3_technical,4_specific,"Not true, 2 of the 3 legs showed similar results. That is a trend"
5074,3_technical,4_specific,This table is showing the same information than the graphs. Avoid repeating information
5075,3_technical,4_specific,What were your analysis methods?
5076,2_writing,2_copyedit,I’m not sure why “therefore” is here as it doesn’t connect anything.
5077,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use to analyze your data?
5078,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If the number of pulses wasn’t 1, you would also need to include frequency."
5079,1_basic,4_specific,Don’t mention your hypothesis in your results section
5080,2_writing,2_copyedit,Unnecessary
5081,2_writing,1_pointer,???
5082,3_technical,4_specific,The error bars are improperly formatted
5083,3_technical,2_copyedit,water agar medium
5084,2_writing,4_specific,"Both of these sentences are repetitive of your first sentence here (which is the best way to say that your hypothesis was not supported). Instead, use this space to interpret your data more."
5085,2_writing,2_copyedit,Affected
5086,3_technical,4_specific,"This seems out of context here. If you’re going to say this, include something about a spectrophotometer and the solution you’re measuring itself."
5087,3_technical,4_specific,"Here would be a good time to reference your first figure ( the line graph) to better show this outlier.  However when you do this, do not explain why it is an outlier just yet. Wait to explain that in your discussion."
5088,3_technical,4_specific,Why did you use different doses for the treatment and control groups?
5089,4_logic,3_general,"While your resource guide does ask you to identify dependent/independent variables, these are sufficiently implied in your hypothesis and statement(s) regarding the hormone you will test, so you do not actually need this extra sentence explicitly identifying them unless you wish to include it."
5090,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much of this did you inject? This is just the concentration
5091,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs right after my first comment.
5092,4_logic,3_general,"Ah, but it is unicellular! (Isn’t Physarum so cool?!)"
5093,4_logic,4_specific,"What happened in this study? You then talk about a different caffeine study in the next sentence, so try and expand on the results of these both a little bit more"
5094,2_writing,4_specific,Title should VERY briefly state the main takeaway of your experiment
5095,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, which statistical test(s) did you run?"
5096,4_logic,2_copyedit,What was the experiment goal and hypothesis?
5097,2_writing,2_copyedit,Word choice?
5098,3_technical,4_specific,Why are you analyzing the SD of different variables. Do you think is relevant to compare the length and the weight?
5099,2_writing,3_general,Colloquial language
5100,3_technical,4_specific,"Since stats weren’t significant, you can’t say there’s a difference. Even if means are slightly different"
5101,3_technical,4_specific,The error bars are out of place. Make sure you choose custom error bars and determine the value for them yourself. Try grouping the legs together rather than grouping the control and treatment together. Let me know if you need help.
5102,2_writing,2_copyedit,Might want to mention muscle in the title somewhere
5103,3_technical,4_specific,Also include the proportions of water and agar in these plates
5104,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would add the p-value in for thoroughness
5105,2_writing,2_copyedit,Can you be more specific
5106,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You need to report the t-value, degrees of freedom, and the p-value in your results. The p-value is the most important here"
5107,4_logic,6_holistic,Talk a little bit about why you think it will prevent weight gain. What will happen inside the caterpillar?
5108,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Said like that, it looks like the age of the Manduca sexta. That is not the age, they were older. Consider saying: after eight days of treatment"
5109,2_writing,3_general,Look out for typos
5110,3_technical,3_general,Cite correctly. See resource guide.
5111,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include stats values here
5112,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Precor is the brand, methoprene is the active chemical in it."
5113,2_writing,3_general,Significantly condense this
5114,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can just leave it as 25mM
5115,2_writing,1_pointer,incomplete.
5116,3_technical,2_copyedit,List the full names of each nutrient.
5117,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Make sure these are brackets [], not parentheses ()"
5118,2_writing,3_general,These two sentences would be more effective if combined
5119,3_technical,4_specific,"Again, this can all go in your methods. The independent and dependent variable are made clear already by saying that you will be testing the effects of Martins IGR.  I understand that you are just trying to state them explicitly, as the resource guide tells you to, but this is unnecessary."
5120,3_technical,2_copyedit,Omit this table. Use the figure
5121,3_technical,4_specific,Add a sentence or more about Rana pipiens and why you are using it.
5122,2_writing,3_general,These can all be condensed into one sentence
5123,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is not meaningful.
5124,3_technical,4_specific,This picture is not the best example to display the results that you mentioned in the figure legend.
5125,4_logic,4_specific,"Not bad justification for your hypothesis, but background on the fact that JH regulates growth/molting in these caterpillars would be better."
5126,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much of this did you inject?
5127,2_writing,2_copyedit,"The inhibitor, not the enzyme per se"
5128,3_technical,4_specific,"Since the stats weren’t significant, you should conclude that there was no difference"
5129,2_writing,4_specific,End with a concluding sentence summarizing your experiment/future directions
5130,2_writing,4_specific,Revise to make formal
5131,2_writing,4_specific,You should include your hypothesis or research question in the Abstract.
5132,2_writing,4_specific,Try to note if you noticed any trends. I would also vaguely include a sentence or 2 about potassium’s role in normal neuromuscular function. Also include your original hypothesis.
5133,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Days, not weeks, otherwise you wouldn’t have time for your experiments!"
5134,3_technical,4_specific,What does this graph mean? There are way too many lines are your legend is unclear
5135,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I would say “can be” here, because Physarum can uptake Ca2+ sans activator."
5136,3_technical,3_general,You should refer people to your figures when you mention the data that they show.
5137,2_writing,3_general,Use passive form
5138,4_logic,6_holistic,But why would this be? At what wavelength of light does chlorophyll absorb. What even is chlorophyll?!?!11!
5139,3_technical,3_general,"Try to stay away from websites as a source unless they are .edu or .gov as they are not scholarly. Any scientific journal articles work. As this isn’t a scholarly source, I will take points off if it’s still in the revision."
5140,3_technical,1_pointer,"Again, not quite!"
5141,2_writing,4_specific,"Rather than starting with this statement, you need to provide background information about Physarum, their transduction pathways and provide evidence with primary literature that A23187 increases cytoplasmic streaming."
5142,4_logic,6_holistic,"Hmm. “Try until you get the result you want” is not a very scientific method. What could you have done in this experiment to increase the likelihood of getting a significant result? And more importantly, how do you explain the results you DID get – what’s the biology there, given your experimental design?No primary source in discussion = does not fulfill basic criteria."
5143,3_technical,4_specific,How is the information in this table different from figure 1? Do not repeat information.
5144,4_logic,4_specific,"Tubocurarine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker. Because we know that acetylcholine must travel across the synapse and bind receptors, if these receptors are blocked, we expect the signal to not continue from nerve to nerve or nerve to muscle. This is the reason we would expect it a decreased muscle contraction."
5145,3_technical,4_specific,You need units in the y-axis
5146,4_logic,6_holistic,You also need to explain light availability in terms of cellular functions and its potential impact on resource allocation specifically.
5147,3_technical,2_copyedit,Length?
5148,3_technical,3_general,Be clear that the replicates were for each experimental condition.
5149,3_technical,4_specific,"Because you talk about twitch threshold, there should be a figure or table that displays them for each leg before and after treatment"
5150,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Precor is the brand, methoprene is the analogue in Precor"
5151,3_technical,4_specific,Here is where you state if your hypothesis was supported or not.
5152,3_technical,3_general,Use your p-value in the future to back this up
5153,4_logic,4_specific,Good find. You may also consider using this in your introduction.
5154,3_technical,4_specific,I think you have these backward. Did it require less voltage to reach the same amplitude (size of contraction)?
5155,3_technical,2_copyedit,2% water-agar
5156,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If using the word significantly, you can include the p-value in parentheses"
5157,3_technical,3_general,Be sure to include figure captions for next time!
5158,2_writing,2_copyedit,"This isn’t really relevant to understanding your experiment, you can take it out."
5159,3_technical,4_specific,So how did you execute the scoring of the fish during the experiment?
5160,3_technical,4_specific,Combine all those figures in just 1. You don’t need one figure/ frog leg
5161,3_technical,2_copyedit,What are your means +/-SDs?
5162,3_technical,4_specific,"What was the used test? This comparison is related with the information in Figure 1, not in the Table."
5163,2_writing,4_specific,Are you sure you mean energy?
5164,3_technical,4_specific,Can you think in a better way of displaying the data? It is difficult to understand the figures with all the colors. Specially differentiate the control group from the treatment group
5165,4_logic,4_specific,expand (Discussion)
5166,4_logic,3_general,You did that. What else might help?
5167,2_writing,4_specific,Add a concluding sentence about future directions/implications and ways to improve your experiment.
5168,2_writing,6_holistic,Are these questions different?
5169,3_technical,4_specific,"In the figures you display trends of the data, not p-values, so you don’t need to make a reference of the figure to explain the statistical analysis"
5170,3_technical,4_specific,Be sure to discuss both dependent variables here
5171,3_technical,2_copyedit,Three plants?
5172,4_logic,3_general,You need to explain what these concepts are more in depth and then relate them to your study
5173,2_writing,2_copyedit,Change to lowercase s throughout the report
5174,4_logic,2_copyedit,I would remove the p values at the end and instead talk about a trend in the results and what you concluded from that trend.
5175,2_writing,3_general,"Hypotheses are neither correct nor incorrect. The data support the hypothesis or make you reject the hypothesis, but that does not mean it was correct or incorrect."
5176,3_technical,3_general,"The standard deviation is not another important figure from the t-test. Actually, you can calculate the SD without conducting a t-test. The SD is a descriptor of your sample, it indicates the amount of dispersion in a set of data values."
5177,2_writing,3_general,"This abstract is too short. If you need help on how to write an abstract or what to include, please come email or talk to me."
5178,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to summarize the results with just 2 bars, instead of showing the raw data for each individual"
5179,4_logic,4_specific,Why? What is affected mechanistically?
5180,3_technical,4_specific,But the p-value was not significant! The paired T-test showed that the thresholds were similar before and after lidocaine injection
5181,2_writing,3_general,These sentences have a lot of unclear language (e.g. you use “this relationship” when referring to several separate relationships).
5182,3_technical,3_general,You need to be more scientific with your language. Make sure you state means and SDs
5183,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
5184,2_writing,3_general,"The flow of your introduction is very good! The only thing that needs revision is your hypothesis, the wording is a little bit confusing."
5185,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to fix the position of the error bars, as well as make sure they represent the correct values.  You will need to calculate the standard deviation for all 16 of these averages, and input those values as “custom” error bars for each bar."
5186,2_writing,2_copyedit,Remove “.”
5187,2_writing,4_specific,This information can be shortened and a full description be put in the intro.
5188,2_writing,2_copyedit,1
5189,3_technical,2_copyedit,always capitalize P
5190,3_technical,2_copyedit,p-value?
5191,3_technical,4_specific,"Am I correct in saying the first p-value is for the amplitude of the muscle at the threshold, and then the second p-value is for the actual threshold values? When stating your p-values, you should also state the t-statistic and degrees of freedom"
5192,3_technical,4_specific,"Figure captions should be self-sufficient, you could specify the studied species and he size of your samples."
5193,3_technical,2_copyedit,Missing the year
5194,2_writing,4_specific,Not necessary in the Abstract
5195,3_technical,4_specific,Control average of what? Change the redaction of this sentence. It is the average of the amplitude of contraction
5196,2_writing,4_specific,You can also cut down on the words here for sure. E.g. average R:S mass was greater in treatment group than in control group (Figure 1).

5202,4_logic,4_specific,Your further studies are limited to Physarum model only. Future implications at a broader scale comparing different organisms models should have been explored and reflected in Abstract accordingly.
5203,2_writing,4_specific,Avoid stating any stat value in the abstract. You can rather say that the significant statistical difference was confirmed by one-way ANOVA test.
5204,2_writing,4_specific,You should have explored few possible reasons on what went wrong in the discussion section. Put the highlights from discussion here as concluding statements.
5205,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? What does blue water change about betta perception?

5211,1_basic,3_general,Outside sources missing (Basic criteria)
5212,3_technical,4_specific,This graph still needs work. Your y-axis label is just a unit. I’m confused about what those black lines are and why there are four bars instead of averages
5213,3_technical,4_specific,You should use this citation to support the significant results you observed.
5214,4_logic,3_general,This one should be backed up with data result
5215,3_technical,4_specific,The mimic or what?
5216,3_technical,4_specific,Copy/pasting my comment from the first submission:Where is series 2?
5217,4_logic,4_specific,"You wouldn’t have had plants to measure! I feel like you are searching for things to discuss here… focus more on what you found and comparing it to other literature on this topic. After this you talk about salinity, but that still doesn’t help you or the reader interpret your results."
5218,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would mention that Martin’s IGR is being used.

5230,2_writing,2_copyedit,Remove filler words like these
5231,3_technical,4_specific,"Remember to include the figure title after the figure number, before the rest of the caption. Given the figure title (which I assume you got from a lab mate), I think it’s fair to say that you’ve misinterpreted the effects of your treatment. Also, this figure needs an x-axis label of some type for each set of bars, not just “Rana pipiens specifmen”"
5232,4_logic,4_specific,I would put the hypothesis in biological context here rather than stats. What is the reasoning behind your hypothesis? This usually comes from previous studies.
5233,4_logic,3_general,"Need to have much more info in the introduction section. Explain the behaviors, why we need to study behavior, and why you would think size has an effect"
5234,3_technical,2_copyedit,Plasticity not adaptivity
5235,2_writing,3_general,Be more specific. You have enough room.
5236,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Your df values should be the same for both tests, because you used the same number of samples, right? Just double check your test, especially because you have a value that is close to significance here."
5237,3_technical,4_specific,"I would reiterate your p-value in the first sentence or two, to state your hypothesis is supported because your results are significant (p&lt;0.05)"

5242,3_technical,4_specific,Reconsider y-axis. Amplitude of contraction (V)
5243,3_technical,8_nobasis,But it didn’t in your experiment though?
5244,2_writing,2_copyedit,The hypotheses was that…
5245,1_basic,4_specific,Do not mention the null hypothesis (or any hypothesis) in the results! I have gone over this repeatedly in class. I warned you in your last lab report that including this would cause the lab report to fail.
5246,3_technical,3_general,Reference your figure somewhere in your results section.
5247,3_technical,4_specific,What do the error bars represent? Where is your x-axis label on this graph?
5248,2_writing,3_general,"You also should never quote scientific literature, only paraphrase."
5249,3_technical,2_copyedit,"It seems like you used one standard deviation for each error bar. Because each day was a separate average (of 3 values), the error bars should be a standard deviation between those 3 averaged values."
5250,4_logic,4_specific,Wait. Then why was your hypothesis different?
5251,3_technical,8_nobasis,What is this made of?
5252,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to specify that you found the average of xxx plants per pot, then used the pot averages for statistics. Also need to specify that it was a “two-sample, one-tailed t-test”"
5253,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can use the actual stats and numbers here if you want
5254,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use?
5255,3_technical,2_copyedit,Dilution? Concentration?
5256,3_technical,4_specific,"I totally didn’t catch this the first time, but you can’t actually run a statistical test like this. The t-test is comparing the average of one group to the average of another, and having an average of different voltages doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to do. However there looks like there is a significant difference between your groups, so your results are probably still significant."
5257,3_technical,4_specific,"Focus less on these anecdotes about individual fish, and just describe the overall trends. Give the p values in the text here. See me if you need more help with the stats"
5258,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Remember Precor is the brand, methoprene is the chemical in precor"

5260,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Precor is the brand, methoprene is the chemical in it"
5261,3_technical,2_copyedit,How similar? Give me means +/- SDs and statistical test results.
5262,3_technical,4_specific,This is a little confusing here without the context of a spec to measure of absorbance of a solution.
5263,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs in the methods. You just need to tell your reader that bettas exhibit a wide range of aggressive behaviors that vary in level of aggression
5264,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This is the average threshold, correct?"
5265,2_writing,2_copyedit,Greatest percent change

5271,3_technical,2_copyedit,"It’s fine to write it this way, but in general if you say average +/- sd everyone know the second number is the standard deviation without you having to write out the words"
5272,4_logic,3_general,"I think you were already doing this but just make it clear that because your results were not significant, the hypothesis was not supported."
5273,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? What are the costs and benefits of aggression?
5274,2_writing,2_copyedit,An example of correctly written reference
5275,2_writing,2_copyedit,Put it in a formal language. Start with “A previous experiment on testing the inhibition… showed that lower concentration..” Revise your lab report to edit any other informal texts

5283,3_technical,4_specific,"The same leg was the control condition and treatment, so write that accordingly"
5284,4_logic,4_specific,What do you think may have caused the difference in what you expected the blocker to do and what actually happened. Do you have any recommendations for if the experiment was repeated?
5285,4_logic,4_specific,Why? How does JH affect length and weight?
5286,2_writing,3_general,"The experiment was performed in the past, therefore it should be reported in past tenses."
5287,2_writing,4_specific,This should be in the discussion.  But why? explain
5288,4_logic,6_holistic,This would be testing something that isn’t hormones. Do you have any ideas for improving the current study regarding hormones and more specifically JH analogues?
5289,4_logic,6_holistic,Food is not an instinct. You also need to better introduce your stimulus. Why is food relevant to aggression?
5290,2_writing,4_specific,You need methods in your abstract
5291,3_technical,4_specific,How comparable? Provide the means and SDs to illustrate your point.
5292,2_writing,4_specific,I’m not sure what this means. (define leading edge)
5293,2_writing,4_specific,These are methods and do not belong in the introduction
5294,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format is [last name : year]
5295,3_technical,4_specific,"You should have another literature source, not only the lab manual"
5296,2_writing,3_general,Methods are written in past tensePut is not very scientific. You don’t need to say that you put the chemical in a syringe and then you injected. Just be more concise.
5297,3_technical,4_specific,0.828 ± 0.583And so on throughout the section
5298,2_writing,4_specific,I guess this is your hypothesis? You should end your introduction with your hypothesis and your experimental goals. This sounds more like a statement of fact to me than it does a hypothesis. Make it clear that you are making a prediction.
5299,2_writing,3_general,Avoid comments so general
5300,2_writing,4_specific,"This abstract needs some reworking. Think two sentences where you introduce muscle contractions and what Ach does, what you will be doing, the hypothesis, main results, and then conclusion"

5302,3_technical,2_copyedit,Alpha level?

5304,3_technical,6_holistic,"No need to explain what the t-test does, but also this is not quite right. A t-test might find no significant difference (as in this case), so the groups are not always statistically significantly different."
5305,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (Basic criteria)
5306,3_technical,2_copyedit,What type of t-test specifically?
5307,3_technical,3_general,"Report t-test results as shown in the resource guide. You need to include the t-stat, df, and p-value. Let me know if you can’t find this in the guide."
5308,3_technical,4_specific,What is regular treatment?
5309,2_writing,4_specific,"You need to start your introductions by explaining biological concepts. In this case, you should start by explaining energy allocation."
5310,3_technical,4_specific,"On which data? Be very specific. From this, I read that you measured the length of the roots and the shoots and compared those lengths with your t-test, but I know that’s not what you did."
5311,2_writing,2_copyedit,Introduce the full form of PDA
5312,3_technical,4_specific,"See my comment on the table – you should also calculate and include R:S for weight. Right now you only have the weights of the entire plants themselves, which weakens your ability to draw conclusions about resource allocation."
5313,2_writing,4_specific,You background information on the subject needs to be more prevalent here. Talk about nerves and muscles more generally and the frog.
5314,4_logic,3_general,No need to discuss sources of error unless you have evidence that it actually affected your results
5315,3_technical,2_copyedit,So error bars = SD?
5316,2_writing,3_general,Methods should be written in past tense
5317,3_technical,4_specific,You do not need these tables because your graph sums them up nicely.
5318,2_writing,4_specific,Intro needs to be substantially condensed and focused more about experiments dealing with different wavelengths – the scholarship is good but the way the ideas are presented could be improved
5319,3_technical,2_copyedit,Delete gridlines
5320,4_logic,4_specific,"Make the connection between DCPIP color, reduction in absorbance, and increase in photosynthetic activity explicit here."
5321,4_logic,3_general,Only report sources of error if you have evidence that they actually affected your results
5322,3_technical,4_specific,This is contradictory! When was longer before or after the drug application? It cannot be longer in both
5323,3_technical,4_specific,citation?
5324,3_technical,3_general,Always cite these things.
5325,3_technical,4_specific,should have focused on the chloroplast isolating procedure and how it could have been improved.
5326,4_logic,4_specific,"Earlier you need to draw some connection between Azamax and weight, why would you see a change in weight?"
5327,2_writing,2_copyedit,I think you may have the name wrong.
5328,3_technical,2_copyedit,Just a paired t-test
5329,2_writing,4_specific,This needs to be at the end of your introduction
5330,3_technical,4_specific,Re-organize the data to plot change in weight for control vs treatment groups
5331,3_technical,4_specific,"As we discussed  this should be unpaired. I’d go ahead and re-do the stats. Please let me know if you have questions about why! Also, why two-tailed?"
5332,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should mention that the muscle is joined to the Achilles tendon
5333,3_technical,4_specific,All of these tables are not needed. The first two are summed up in your figures and the second two should be in paragraph form in the results.
5334,2_writing,4_specific,"“confidence interval” has a very specific statistical meaning, so make sure you are using it correctly or come up with another way to phrase this."
5335,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Talking about your trends is fine, but don’t use the word significant, as that implies you have specific statistics to compare weight for each day of your experiment"
5336,3_technical,2_copyedit,Incorrect error bars. See me if you need help with them
5337,3_technical,4_specific,"any time you have an average graphed, you will need standard deviation bars (The standard deviation error bar option on excel doesn’t work properly, take a look at the resource guide or email me to learn how to add it properly). As such, this graph should have 14 standard deviation bars total."
5338,3_technical,4_specific,"While this is a fun detail, it doesn’t really belong in a scientific paper unless you are making a point with it (like the fact that M. sexta is a good model organism because it has been studied for so long)"
5339,2_writing,4_specific,change in what? formula?
5340,3_technical,4_specific,"Methoprene is actually the active in gradient in Precor, so you can note that and further relate it to your study"
5341,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs in the methods section
5342,2_writing,4_specific,Start with and intro sentence and describe how acetylcholine normally functions in the cell
5343,3_technical,4_specific,Report means as mean +/- sd. Combine both types of behavior into a total aggression score.
5344,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Specify rpm, time, temperature"
5345,3_technical,4_specific,"Not necessary. That could be important in the figure legend, but in the results you can just mention that the threshold of contraction after lidocaine injection double the threshold for the control."
5346,3_technical,4_specific,Still missing a description of the behaviors you measured
5347,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can just put the p-value here
5348,3_technical,2_copyedit,Embed your (in)dependent variables here.
5349,3_technical,4_specific,This is not primary literature and is not cited within the text either
5350,3_technical,3_general,Careful of sounding like you are ignoring your stats/results
5351,3_technical,4_specific,Missing y-axis. Is this the amplitude of the threshold or the amplitude of the contraction that was generated at the threshold?Specify the y-axis depending on that
5352,3_technical,6_holistic,"Also look at the variance of your data! You clearly had outliers of some sort, what’s a possible solution?"
5353,2_writing,2_copyedit,Lowercase s
5354,3_technical,2_copyedit,Includee p-values here.
5355,3_technical,2_copyedit,Error bars represent…
5356,2_writing,4_specific,This title could use some reworking. Try something like “The effects of excess juvenile hormone on growth in Manduca sexta caterpillars” or use the chemical name instead of JH
5357,2_writing,3_general,Do not quote the title
5358,4_logic,3_general,Too little indication to future implication. Should have explored this aspect at a greater detail with providing reference to relevant primary lit
5359,3_technical,3_general,You should mention the direct observation. What was the obtained result. Just saying that they were statistically significant is not enough.
5360,3_technical,2_copyedit,An inverted phase
5361,3_technical,2_copyedit,Give the p-value here.
5362,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
5363,3_technical,4_specific,Are you sure it is significant?
5364,2_writing,4_specific,"In general, the background information is correct. However, I will work more in the story. You can omit some details about the life cycle that are nor very relevant for this experiment and try to link your sentences more. Establish the connections between the background information and your hypothesis"
5365,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not necessary
5366,3_technical,4_specific,"Seems like both your figures need to have the error bars fixed because they are not for each specific treatment, once again confused on what error they are though"
5367,1_basic,3_general,You need to include a citation in your discussion.  It cannot be the lab manual
5368,2_writing,2_copyedit,"This is the direct opposite of your hypothesis, and the following sentence."
5369,3_technical,2_copyedit,"But, the plates are circles…"
5370,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This should be a year, but this year has not happened yet"
5371,3_technical,3_general,Make sure to run a paired t-test next time
5372,3_technical,4_specific,"Im only going to correct you on this once, rather than every time in your report but Azamax is an Ecdysone Blocker, meaning it causes the caterpillar to no be able to produce ecdysone. Azamax does nothing to the production of JH."
5373,2_writing,3_general,revise
5374,3_technical,2_copyedit,Amount of food
5375,3_technical,4_specific,Statistical test?
5376,3_technical,3_general,Never include raw data in a lab report
5377,3_technical,4_specific,Since the stats weren’t significant you have to conclude that there was no difference in the mass.
5378,2_writing,6_holistic,"This is an abrupt jump. Instead, maybe you could transition by talking about how salinity affects plants or why might we care about salinity in particular.Example: “Because they are sessile organisms, plants must be able to adjust to adverse environmental conditions, such as the increases in salinity that are expected to affect coastal areas as sea levels rise due to warming temperatures (Citation).” – Don’t use that, obviously, but that’s an example of what I mean by a better transition.Otherwise your introduction is pretty good!"

5389,3_technical,4_specific,You need another citation more. Just the lab manual is not enough
5390,2_writing,4_specific,This section is a little long. Try to shorten this if you can by stating some of the observations in the results and referencing them in the discussion.
5391,3_technical,4_specific,You need stats and explanation of error bars in your caption. Your error bars are also improperly formatted. See me if you need help.
5392,4_logic,3_general,Would be good to talk about some more biological mechanisms here.
5393,2_writing,8_nobasis,What does this mean?
5394,4_logic,3_general,Be very clear that this is your hypothesis
5395,1_basic,4_specific,"Don’t state the effect on your hypothesis in the results section, this is close to failing a basic criteria, just report the stats and move on."
5396,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Is this an article? Yes! Then, the citation formatting is not right."
5397,3_technical,4_specific,"This graph needs some tweaking.  Be sure you use Custom error bars and input your own values. This should make sure the error bars line up well on the bar graph.Also, create a legend and fix the x-axis label."
5398,3_technical,2_copyedit,Did this t-test compare mean percent change values? Be specific!
5399,2_writing,2_copyedit,Grammatical error: decrease
5400,4_logic,3_general,You need to introduce all elements of your hypothesis before you formally state your hypothesis.
5401,2_writing,4_specific,"This was your prediction, then you should mention it like that. Instead I would mention the effect of caffeine in the relaxation process of the muscle and then state your prediction."
5402,3_technical,2_copyedit,What are their magnitudes?

5406,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is repetitive.
5407,4_logic,4_specific,"Both your control and treatment should exhibit growth, but treatment group should exhibit significantly higher growth."
5408,2_writing,3_general,No citations in the Abstract
5409,3_technical,4_specific,I see why you might think that but the stats actually imply a slightly different response
5410,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much? What concentration?
5411,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You can combine these into one sentence, 2.75 +/- 0.72g"
5412,4_logic,4_specific,Need a little more info here. Some background info about why size may or may not affect aggressive display
5413,3_technical,3_general,"Typically, if more than two treatments are involved (in this case, you used 3 including the control), an ANOVA would be used. But since there were just 3, I’ll let this go. Do let me know, however, if you’d like to learn more about ANOVA in case you need to know it in the future"
5414,3_technical,2_copyedit,These figures should not have titles.  The “Treatment group vs Control group” is not needed.Same goes for the one below.
5415,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations? Stats?
5416,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use?
5417,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is repetitive.
5418,4_logic,4_specific,"It would be more informative to say something like, the differences in R:S ratios between the two groups were not enough to be significant. Something to consider – do you think a larger sample size might have helped you find significant results? Why/why not?"
5419,3_technical,4_specific,"Copy-pasting my comment from your original report: “Is there a more accurate and informative y-axis label that you could use? Right now it appears that you are showing the total height and total weight of the plants, which I don’t think is your goal.”"
5420,3_technical,4_specific,"If one fish never exhibited aggression, remove it from your data set and reanalyze the data. Its fine to remove drastic outliers so long as you mention it."
5421,4_logic,4_specific,It seemed that your finding was unexpected. You had three alternatives: 1. Refer to several other primary lit that proved trifluoperazine as an inhibitor and thus suggest to use it in cancer cell treatment or 2.

But, testing the betta responses to another species is the core goal of your experiment and you only included the intraspecific interactions as a control. So, there’s a mismatch here that is a bit confusing. Rework the introduction to better present the goal of your experiment and set up your hypothesis. I am particularly wondering why you thought the bettas would be more aggressive toward the tetra fish, that’s the opposite of what I would have predicted, which is another reason why having more background on interspecific interactions would be very helpful here."

5638,4_logic,4_specific,"Throughout the report there was a lot of focus on the threshold of contraction but you never tied the threshold value back to how it relates to your hypothesis or why it may be of interest.

Therefore, it would be worth looking into this in future studies”"

5738,2_writing,4_specific,I would suggest to remove this segment. Open your introduction by stating the importance of experimenting salinity to measure photosynthesis activity. Because scientific papers are written for peers sharing similar knowledge/experience background.

It’s the same as in people, where you can’t just eat more and more to make up for not drinking. You will still die without access to water, and so will plants.

6129,3_technical,4_specific,How did you do this? Using the leading strand? A central axis across all three cubes?
6130,3_technical,4_specific,"Some problems with interpretation here. Yes, your p value was close to 0.05, but it was higher than 0.05 which means there’s not a significant difference. Stick with a “black and white” interpretation of statistics"

6134,3_technical,3_general,Just focus on the biological explanations of the results.
6135,2_writing,4_specific,Make sure this is really clear and obvious in your introduction. What is the connection between 20E and growth/development
6136,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would write control
6137,2_writing,6_holistic,"This opening sentence is a little bit convoluted – can you be more specific and direct about what you mean? Are we really interested in ability to maintain homeostasis, or something slightly different?"
6138,2_writing,3_general,Write methods in past tense
6139,2_writing,6_holistic,"I would avoid using the word “prove” and “correct.” Due to the uncertain nature of science, your results could be interpreted in different ways. As such, we try to avoid words such as “prove” and “correct” and opt for words such as “our hypothesis was supported.”"
6140,2_writing,2_copyedit,capitalize P
6141,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to specify that you measured xxx plants per pot, and used the pot averages in statistics"
6142,4_logic,4_specific,"You mentioned salt, then all of these other ions, and then back to salt. This is confusing. Stick with just talking about salinity and its effects on plant resource allocation here in the introduction. You may want to search for another primary source to support your statements."

6144,2_writing,2_copyedit,?
6145,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t use quotations, just paraphrase the literature."

6152,3_technical,2_copyedit,"How much did you inject? Also, it’s just tubocurarine, no blocker"
6153,4_logic,4_specific,This doesn’t quite match with your conclusion that size has no effect on female choice

6163,3_technical,4_specific,The error bars on the graph do not reflect these values.
6164,2_writing,4_specific,At the end of the discussion indicate possible implications of your experiment at a broader scale
6165,2_writing,4_specific,"You provided very solid content, but your grammar needs a lot of work. There were a bunch of subject verb disagreement issues and you ended sentences with prepositions."
6166,4_logic,3_general,This is a very ambitious statement.
6167,3_technical,4_specific,"So here, all of the tubes have the same contents. You can therefore just tell us what one tube contained, then say that triplicates were tested in each of your temperature conditions."

6169,3_technical,2_copyedit,You don’t need to include the date

6178,3_technical,2_copyedit,ANOVA tests variances
6179,3_technical,2_copyedit,I asked for means and SDs here too.
6180,2_writing,3_general,Avoid starting sentences with numbers
6181,2_writing,3_general,This is a good abstract. See if you can edit/ condense it somewhat to get rid of the typos/lack of spaces between sentences and keep the end from being cut off.
6182,2_writing,4_specific,Missing the obtained results. That should be included in the Abstract
6183,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use?
6184,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
6185,4_logic,6_holistic,"Okay, I like that you tried to make this connection, but I’m not sure it’s the right one. You were interested in quantifying aggressive behavior, which is very different than studying build ups of dangerous chemicals in fish tissues. I think it might be more useful for you to go back to thinking about the evolution of behavior, and perhaps the role of artificial selection in determining what behaviors we see in animals (just one idea)."
6186,3_technical,3_general,Reference your figures

6193,3_technical,2_copyedit,Same here with the format. [author : year]
6194,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If you’re going to reference authors’ names, you generally include the citation again at the end of the sentence, even if you’ve already cited it previously."
6195,3_technical,4_specific,"Average distance and sd should go in figure caption. Report your stat findings in results section by specifying the treatment and using this format at the end of the sentence in a parenthesis (t-stat=_,d.f.=_, p=_)"
6196,2_writing,3_general,The abstract should have at least one sentence wih background information. Something like an introduction to the topic.
6197,3_technical,2_copyedit,Do not cite your hypothesis
6198,2_writing,4_specific,Can you be more specific? Studied physiological process.
6199,3_technical,4_specific,"for both of your experiments, consider how efficient you were in isolating the chloroplasts.."

6201,3_technical,3_general,Raw Data (basic criteria)
6202,3_technical,4_specific,"That would explain why the control animals were smaller, because they were probably losing weight before pupation."
6203,3_technical,2_copyedit,Could you change the yellow color text? It is difficult to read.
6204,2_writing,3_general,Keep your tenses consistent
6205,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Have the bars says control and treatment underneath. Also, your error bars look to be the same size for both groups, which is incorrect. Also, your x-axis label doesn’t really make any sese (the amount of amps of what?)"
6206,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
6207,3_technical,4_specific,What clear errors?
6208,3_technical,4_specific,"The corpus cardiacum is a neurohemal organ, so it doesn’t secrete hormones. The brain hormone, according to its name, is produced in the brain by neurosecretory cells."
6209,2_writing,3_general,"Explain how this worked in the lab a bit more. You may want to consider leading the intro with it, instead of burying it here."
6210,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Even though this is also interesting to look at, the first figure shows roughly the same thing, so you don’t need to include this."
6211,1_basic,3_general,You need to have citation in your introduction. This is an automatic failing grade
6212,4_logic,3_general,Don’t say this. Try and come up with biological reasons for your results
6213,3_technical,4_specific,The physical weight of the mycorrhizae itself is likely negligible. Look for literature explaining the effects of mycorrhizae on roots.
6214,3_technical,4_specific,No chloroplast is not your control. Chloroplast under full light with no herbicide and no pH manipulation is your control.
6215,3_technical,3_general,The figure legends are not self-explanatory. You should be more precise and give enough information to understand the graphs.
6216,2_writing,4_specific,you could include this in the results section.
6217,3_technical,2_copyedit,Do you have your p-value to support this? You can state it in parentheses

6219,4_logic,4_specific,"Or, in a more positive light (ha!), lights could be utilized to optimize growth."
6220,3_technical,4_specific,How many muscles are included in the analysis? You can specify that and the studied species in the figures captions
6221,2_writing,4_specific,Good spot to include what you had in the abstract

6223,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Azamax is the brand, azadirachtin is the IGR in it"
6224,4_logic,4_specific,"Based on what you currently have, make sure to say whether your hypothesis was or wasn’t supported (I understand that it’s glaringly obvious that there was little difference in threshold voltage but I would still add in a p-value). Afterwards, you can discuss why the data may not properly reflect the role of potassium channel blockers and how it can be improved."
6225,3_technical,4_specific,"You can state this as a general trend, but you can’t say this for sure since your results were insignificant"
6226,3_technical,4_specific,"A one-way ANOVA test should’ve been used first. Then if there was significance, use the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test to see which treatments different significantly from each other or not. Since excel doesn’t give you p-values in Tukey-Kramer, then you can use a two-sample t test to determine what the p-values are from the groups that are significant"
6227,3_technical,3_general,Only include primary literature citations
6228,3_technical,3_general,Please refer to the BioCore Resource Guide for how to format in-text citations.
6229,4_logic,4_specific,This is not an explanation for the obtained results. Can you think in a more plausible explanation for the lack of effect of JH in the growth of Manduca sexta?
6230,3_technical,4_specific,Your results should also state some general trends about the data. Which group had the higher threshold stimulus?
6231,3_technical,2_copyedit,What chemical are you using?
6232,3_technical,4_specific,Did you follow-up with a Tukey-Karmer?
6233,3_technical,4_specific,"You should not run a t-test on these values.  You should calculate the difference between the weight on the first day and the weight on the last day for each caterpillar, then run a t-test on those values."
6234,3_technical,4_specific,mention that Physarum stock was already prepared/grown prior to experiment
6235,3_technical,3_general,"Never include raw data in a lab report, only summary data"
6236,2_writing,3_general,Revise these two statements.
6237,3_technical,4_specific,The error bars are not formatted properly. (contact me if you need help with the formatting)
6238,3_technical,2_copyedit,percent
6239,3_technical,2_copyedit,Remember to begin captions with the figure number and title (e.g. “Figure 1. Average weight gain in Manduca sexta…”)
6240,3_technical,4_specific,"You should specify that those increments in the twitch duration were observed for all the tested muscles. That is the difference between the figures and the tables and you should emphasize that. According to the text, it looks like the same information but it is not."
6241,3_technical,6_holistic,"Not necessary, you already mention that you used Ringer solution."
6242,3_technical,4_specific,Needs citation
6243,3_technical,3_general,These are raw data
6244,3_technical,2_copyedit,The first sentence (faux title) should be describing exactly what the graph is showing
6245,2_writing,3_general,be more specific
6246,3_technical,4_specific,"Again, this should be percent change—not absorbance—plotted if you want to report percent change values in your results section. You don’t need to include the blank, but all of these data points should have individual error bars since you had replicates."
6247,3_technical,4_specific,This seems more like intro material.
6248,3_technical,3_general,Data did not support alt hypoth and could not reject null.
6249,3_technical,4_specific,"Would be better to build these graphs with just 1 series, and have x axis labels for the categories instead of a legend. Need y axis labels and units for all graphs"
6250,3_technical,4_specific,Need to have y axis labels and units. Don’t need a title
6251,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This is a journal, not an author"
6252,2_writing,2_copyedit,You can get rid of this line.
6253,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I’m confused about why this graph looks like this, or what the axes are. You should have the voltage label on the y-axis, and then just two bars labelled control and treatment on the x-axis"
6254,4_logic,4_specific,Make sure you tie your results back to the big picture
6255,3_technical,2_copyedit,Two-sample

6259,2_writing,2_copyedit,Delete
6260,2_writing,4_specific,Need some more info about how acid rain would affect plants specifically
6261,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I appreciate the idea of this graph, but the axes need to have better labels. Honestly though, I think you can exclude it, because your Figure 1 also shows most of the specimens decreasing in weight over time"
6262,3_technical,4_specific,Which statistical test?
6263,3_technical,2_copyedit,"When reporting the results of a two-sample t-test, you need to include the resulting t-statistic, the degrees of freedom (df), and the corresponding P-value. Your statement might look like this, “The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.57, df = 26, P = 0.574).”"
6264,3_technical,8_nobasis,Good. And gives us an indication of how Physarum moves in a neutral environment…
6265,4_logic,3_general,This discussion could be expanded a bit. Additional references to other studies might help with this.
6266,3_technical,4_specific,"This section is still too long. Just state the trend, the p value, and refer to the figure"
6267,3_technical,2_copyedit,Round the numbers
6268,2_writing,4_specific,You should include the hypothesis in the Abstract also

6274,2_writing,4_specific,What are those typical stages? Try to be precise every time that you can
6275,3_technical,3_general,Any numbers need to have units
6276,3_technical,3_general,Can you be more specific in your title? At least mention the physiological process that you studied
6277,3_technical,4_specific,"If your p-value is above 0.05, your results are not statistical significant, so you got that part right. However, this means that you fail to reject the null hypothesis, and can’t accept your alternative. So your results are not significant, and you can’t talk about your weight differences as though they are."
6278,2_writing,2_copyedit,You don’t need this in here
6279,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass"
6280,2_writing,6_holistic,Are you sure it is the correct tense for this section? Check with other primary lit
6281,2_writing,2_copyedit,"In some cases, you had five muscles."
6282,2_writing,3_general,Careful of getting too redundant
6283,2_writing,3_general,Informal. Consider revising.

6285,2_writing,3_general,informal
6286,2_writing,2_copyedit,You shouldn’t introduce ethology
6287,2_writing,2_copyedit,No contractions in science writing
6288,3_technical,2_copyedit,Roughly 70µL
6289,4_logic,3_general,Leave your personal analysis out of it and just state what you think.
6290,2_writing,3_general,Software details are not necessary in the Abstract
6291,3_technical,4_specific,What abought the width of the stimulus?
6292,3_technical,4_specific,"You don’t need to include the t-test information in this table, and you don’t need a table that shows the same thing as your figure does. Choose either a table or a figure (figures are generally better) to present these data."
6293,2_writing,3_general,Decrease  amount of information about methodology and include some background information.
6294,3_technical,3_general,"Make sure you don’t have raw data, and you need error bars on graphs"
6295,3_technical,2_copyedit,Please give me mean(s) +/- SDs.
6296,4_logic,4_specific,"Not necessarily. IGR’s by definition hinder an insect’s normal life cycle and can be done in more ways than just mimicking a hormone. Azamax’s active ingredient does not mimic a hormone. Try to find which hormone Azamax affects. Then, discuss more in detail what that hormone does in the Manduca’s regular life cycle.This is what this hormone normally does -&gt; This is what Azamax does to that hormone -&gt; As such, this is what we expect will happen in the Manducas"
6297,3_technical,4_specific,This sounds like observational results that should go in the results section.
6298,2_writing,4_specific,Revise to make formal

6305,3_technical,1_pointer,0.5.3?
6306,2_writing,4_specific,This is part of the methods
6307,2_writing,2_copyedit,This should be implied.

6309,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations? 2 sig figs is enough.
6310,3_technical,2_copyedit,This will change when you recalculate the t-test
6311,4_logic,3_general,Why might that happen? Biologically or chemically?
6312,3_technical,2_copyedit,None of this should be in your figure caption
6313,3_technical,4_specific,Why do you have R:S for length but not for weight? Should include R:S for weight as well.
6314,3_technical,3_general,See p. 42 in the resource guide for correct citation format (not the same as the annotation exercise)
6315,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is a confusing sentence.
6316,2_writing,3_general,Find a way to make this more concise.
6317,2_writing,6_holistic,Informal. Use your best judgement to locate all the informal/colloquial terms/texts/formats used in this report and revise accordingly.
6318,2_writing,4_specific,Just start by introducing resource allocation as a concept. This jumps into the specifics of your experiment too quiuckly
6319,3_technical,4_specific,"You don’t need this table because the data are shown in your figures. You SHOULD report those means and standard deviations in the text of your results section, though."
6320,3_technical,4_specific,Reconsider this sentence. It is confusing
6321,3_technical,2_copyedit,SDs?
6322,2_writing,3_general,"Do not quote previous studies, explain their results with your own words."
6323,2_writing,4_specific,This is implied but should be mentioned in the intro section

6325,3_technical,4_specific,What test did you perform? Try to be precise with the writting

6333,3_technical,2_copyedit,“treated with trifluoperazine in 2% water-agar medium” would have been clearer. Or else it means that you treatment group only had your inhibitor and nothing else in the medium
6334,4_logic,4_specific,How does this relate back to your experiment?
6335,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Second, your graphs don’t need titles, because whatever is in the title will be in your figure caption."
6336,3_technical,2_copyedit,When? Specify the day of the photograph
6337,2_writing,2_copyedit,You mentioned this in results.
6338,3_technical,3_general,You need a legend
6339,3_technical,4_specific,"Average p-value?What did you compare? Did you compare the length at day 8 between groups? Then you should specify that and you can report the mean ± SD for each group to make those difference more evident, and report the statistical outcome at the end of the sentence (t-value, p-value) to support the result."
6340,3_technical,2_copyedit,mL
6341,2_writing,4_specific,This should go before you mention the methods briefly
6342,2_writing,4_specific,"The way you’ve phrased this here almost makes it seem like you have two hypotheses.

6360,3_technical,2_copyedit,Solutions of what? Include what they are and volumes of each
6361,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can use “mL”
6362,4_logic,4_specific,"Don’t state this, you did a pretty good job accounting for the distribution of the food"
6363,3_technical,4_specific,"As creating the schedule is of less interest to the reader than having a consistent feeding schedule, I may only say they were fed at 4pm each day for seven days."
6364,3_technical,2_copyedit,"You have improved but it is still recipe-style writing. Suggestion: You could open your section by saying that “The slurry/ground mixture of chickweed was centrifuged using (name of the machine we used to centrifuge) at XG, Xrmp, at Xdegrees for Xmins to extract/isolate the chloroplasts. Any debris was removed and the solution was centrifuged again (mention specifications). The pellet was isolated and treated with Hill reaction assay (Table# provided in the supplement) to quantify photosynthesis activity. The absorbances were recorded…”"
6365,3_technical,4_specific,We’re not really fixing carbon at this point.
6366,3_technical,4_specific,Maybe this was a limitation of your experiment. You should change the food daily.
6367,4_logic,3_general,"Your conclusion that xxx was higher than yyy should be based on the statistics, not just how the graph looks"
6368,4_logic,6_holistic,What is the bigger picture? Why does understanding how salinity affect photosynthesis important?
6369,2_writing,2_copyedit,Instead of frog 1-3. I would say Muscle 1-3
6370,2_writing,2_copyedit,Lowercase p

6373,3_technical,2_copyedit,"The same leg was the control and treatment condition. Say it like that, seems like they were different legs."
6374,3_technical,4_specific,How is the information in this table different from figure 2? Do not repeat information.
6375,4_logic,4_specific,Your hypothesis was partially supported
6376,4_logic,4_specific,"True, but this still does not explain phenotypic plasticity within the same species of lants"
6377,3_technical,2_copyedit,Does not significantly change would be a better way to put it
6378,3_technical,4_specific,This is not primary peer-reviewed literature. See me if you need help finding primary lit
6379,3_technical,3_general,"In future, I would suggest converting this from a bulleted list to a full paragraph."
6380,3_technical,4_specific,"Not true, you reported the threshold of stimulation for three muscles in the results."
6381,2_writing,3_general,Probably too much detail
6382,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Avoid the word “prove.” In sciences, there is always some uncertainty involved. Your data may always have come from a reason separate from your original hypothesis. As such, I would say “supported”"
6383,3_technical,4_specific,Problem with standard errors. Those look the same How is this information different from the table? Avoid repeating information
6384,2_writing,3_general,"It’s recommended that you use scientific articles (from scientific journals) as your sources. If websites are used, it’s recommended you only use .gov or .edu websites."

6386,3_technical,2_copyedit,dH20
6387,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what temp?
6388,3_technical,4_specific,"Mention your study organism, what muscle you are using, and why it is helpful"
6389,3_technical,2_copyedit,standard dev?
6390,3_technical,4_specific,You have the same figure 4 times. Reconsider the x-axisProblem with the standard errors. They look the same.
6391,3_technical,2_copyedit,Where? Is it oxidized or reduced?
6392,3_technical,2_copyedit,Put the whole year – you changed it everywhere else nicely!
6393,3_technical,2_copyedit,Dilution: 1 ml of “1x” test compound
6394,3_technical,4_specific,This needs citation at the end of the sentence.
6395,2_writing,3_general,"This is ambiguous, based on previous knowledge, you can make a prediction."
6396,4_logic,6_holistic,Can you think of a biological reason why your results may have occurred?
6397,4_logic,4_specific,"Isn’t your study about betta fish? Mountain goats also exhibit aggressive behavior, would you expect blue dye to change their aggression levels? You need to tie this back to how blue dye changes the perceptual experience of the fish and elaborate on that."
6398,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the p-values here.
6399,2_writing,4_specific,"This should be the very last part of the intro. Your introduction should give me enough information that by the end of it, I agree with the hypothesis that you are presenting."
6400,2_writing,4_specific,This could be mentioned before the previous sentence
6401,3_technical,3_general,Your figure caption should relay what you want me to get out of looking at your figure.
6402,1_basic,3_general,"This will have to receive a 1/4  for now, although you can improve your grade for the second submission"
6403,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make a plot for control vs treatment (2 bars only)
6404,2_writing,3_general,Start more broadly
6405,3_technical,4_specific,Is that the muscle name?
6406,3_technical,4_specific,This is not necessary if you specify since the beginning that the procedure was for 3 frog legs.
6407,2_writing,3_general,I’m confused on what you’re trying to say with this sentence.
6408,4_logic,4_specific,"Not really, careful here. Your hypothesis was not supported because your stats say there wasn’t a significant difference in their change in weight"
6409,3_technical,4_specific,"You shouldn’t include this, your graphs provide enough information."
6410,3_technical,4_specific,needs citation
6411,2_writing,2_copyedit,"I didn’t catch this last time, but you already performed your experiment, right? So, we hypothesized that…."
6412,3_technical,4_specific,What was the averaged variable?
6413,3_technical,3_general,At some point it may be beneficial to mention the averages and standard devs
6414,3_technical,3_general,Be sure to include the figure captions for your figures next time.
6415,4_logic,4_specific,Or maybe use this to their advantage?
6416,3_technical,4_specific,"0.03mL, next time do the math as well, don’t make your reader calculate how many mL you added"
6417,2_writing,1_pointer,?
6418,2_writing,1_pointer,unclear
6419,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence is unnecessary
6420,2_writing,4_specific,Mention what Ach normally does in muscle contraction
6421,2_writing,2_copyedit,I would avoid the word “significant” here as it is a statistical word which means a statistical test was run to find that the higher threshold was unlikely due to chance.
6422,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would include the number of pulses and the width for each of these voltages
6423,3_technical,2_copyedit,What are the units of this?
6424,2_writing,4_specific,"This can be consolidate with the comment above. You would say that the results support the hypothesis, and then state the p-values.  You would then include a sentence about the biological reason why you got the results and why adding JH would have had this effect."
6425,3_technical,3_general,"Statistic outcomes should be mentioned in the results, not only in the figure legend."
6426,2_writing,4_specific,Passive voice is recommended. I wrote that following the same ideas that you were mentioning. Nonetheless in the Abstract is not necessary to give so many details.
6427,3_technical,4_specific,Did you do this for each fish or each pair of fish? What stats test did you use to analyze the datat?
6428,2_writing,2_copyedit,Run on
6429,3_technical,2_copyedit,Refer to figures. Include your t-test results to justify.
6430,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include these with their corresponding means.

6434,3_technical,2_copyedit,"In the future, put the x axis labels under the columns instead of in a legend"
6435,3_technical,4_specific,"While I like how clean the myogram photos are, it’s a little much to look at. If you want to include them I would say put control and treatment for just one leg as a representative of the overall pattern"
6436,3_technical,2_copyedit,Paired t-test
6437,1_basic,4_specific,"In your results section, just put your p-value and state whether it is significant or not. You discussion is where you talk about what that means for your hypothesis."
6438,3_technical,2_copyedit,Need to provide molarity of test compound and dilution calculation for 1x to 20x
6439,3_technical,4_specific,What’s GE? Capitalize your y-axis.
6440,2_writing,4_specific,This section contains a lot of fragments. Either combine the sentences somehow or continue the thought the make it a complete sentence
6441,2_writing,3_general,Be more explicit about comparisons
6442,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t need this, just write a sentence or two in your results section."
6443,3_technical,4_specific,"As the word “significant” is a statistical word, you can simply say “significantly” here."
6444,2_writing,4_specific,"This belongs at the end of your intro, NOT your methods."
6445,4_logic,3_general,"This would be a great discussion if your hypothesis had been supported, see note at bottom."
6446,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
6447,3_technical,4_specific,"You didn’t have different legs for control and experimental groups. The same leg was for both conditions, so write everything in correspondence with that."
6448,2_writing,4_specific,This detail is not useful. You may say “ Frog Muscle twitch found in I-works software was used to…” etc
6449,3_technical,2_copyedit,Also put units here
6450,2_writing,2_copyedit,Try to rephrase this
6451,2_writing,2_copyedit,Use the actual word
6452,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Either explain this more, or remove it. I heard Madeline talk about this in class so I know what you’re talking about but you need more info in your discussion about this if you want to bring it up."
6453,3_technical,4_specific,"Technically you should only choose one type of statistical test: t-test or ANOVA. But I can argue for using both. So in this case, you can use an ANOVA, then if there is a significant p-value, look at which groups are significant from each other, then only run a t-test for those groups so you can get a p-value for those. Come talk to me if that still doesn’t make sense"
6454,3_technical,2_copyedit,2 sig figs is enough!
6455,4_logic,4_specific,Why does this matter to root : shoot?
6456,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Stats?! You were planning to do stats, right?"
6457,2_writing,3_general,"Two things, this is a sentence fragment, and also when you cite things in a scientific paper you should not include quotes, they must be paraphrased. Even if you use quotation marks, it’s still not acceptable in scientific literature."
6458,3_technical,2_copyedit,Precor is just the name of the pesticide. I would leave it as “Precor” rather than “Precor Hormone”
6459,1_basic,3_general,"You NEED to include a citation in your discussion (that isn’t the lab manual, b/c the lab manual does not count as a citation)"
6460,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include your stat result in parenthesis.
6461,2_writing,4_specific,Rearrange this to put the hypothesis as the last sentence of the intro.
6462,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Nope, just a two sample t-test"
6463,3_technical,4_specific,"What data did you input into the t-test?  You said in your results that every leg experienced tetany, how could that be insignificant?"
6464,3_technical,4_specific,And please give me these p-values.
6465,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
6466,3_technical,4_specific,"This is not really relevant because both f them were in the same treatment, probably control animals."
6467,4_logic,4_specific,"This discussion needs a little bit of work. You interpreted your p-value incorrectly at this bottom of the discussion, which affects the rest of the paragraph. Talk about your p-value first, and then go into the rest of the discussion. I like your explanation with PTTH, so I would keep that, but you will have to rework the paragraph so it state that while your results are not significant, this is the mechanism behind how precor works, and if you alter the experiment by getting rid of sources of error or changing things around your results could be different."
6468,3_technical,4_specific,"Once again, you can’t do a t-test over a range of voltages"
6469,2_writing,2_copyedit,I already modified this sentence in the results. Check that
6470,3_technical,2_copyedit,Put the total number of legs you used in your data (i.e. pretend you had 4)
6471,3_technical,2_copyedit,Control frog legs
6472,1_basic,4_specific,This is an interpretation of the result. That is not part of this section. It goes in the discussion.
6473,2_writing,4_specific,Mention briefly what acetylcholine normally does in cells at the beginning
6474,2_writing,4_specific,"You make a lot of good points here just try to work on the organization of this section, it seems like you jump around a lot so maybe rework this a little."
6475,4_logic,3_general,"If this is your statement about support for your hypothesis, make that clearer. Your first couple sentences should clearly establish whether or not your hypothesis was supported."
6476,3_technical,2_copyedit,This table is completely unnecessary
6477,3_technical,4_specific,What is the name of this figure? Figure 1 Consider the order of the figure legend. Explain figures from top to bottom.What did you mean with graph 1 (left)? There is only one graph on top.Graphs do not compare and you are not showing the statistical analysis in the graph.
6478,3_technical,3_general,Do not include raw data in your lab report.
6479,3_technical,4_specific,The amplitude size doesn’t indicate how quickly a contraction occurs but how strong that contraction is.
6480,3_technical,2_copyedit,remove (List of materials)
6481,2_writing,3_general,Be more precise
6482,2_writing,2_copyedit,"You already have that info in proceeding sentences, so it just adds extra words."
6483,3_technical,3_general,It didn’t based on your p-value though
6484,3_technical,3_general,"You need to make sure your study is reproducible, you haven’t explained the steps you took during the experiment"
6485,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is higher than 0.05
6486,3_technical,2_copyedit,Test or experimental condition
6487,3_technical,3_general,"We cite Authors, not publishers"
6488,3_technical,4_specific,Didn’t you guys used PDA plates throughout?
6489,3_technical,4_specific,Why two-tailed here?
6490,2_writing,3_general,No need to include this in your abstract (or intro)
6491,4_logic,3_general,How is this study similar or not to your own experiment?
6492,3_technical,4_specific,"This technically fulfills the requirement for primary literature in the discussion. However, you should consider referring to more than just one source throughout the entire paper."
6493,4_logic,4_specific,"Is this important? I see that you’re trying to introduce the metabolic costs of aggression, but you need to do so in a more direct manner."
6494,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to include more in these captions.  Include the legend (blue means this, grey means that), and the respective statistics results for each figure."
6495,2_writing,4_specific,"This is a little too much information for a title. As you talk about it in the introduction, I would consider leaving this out."
6496,3_technical,2_copyedit,Still need to see the standard deviations
6497,4_logic,4_specific,What does R:S tell us about growth? Why is it important to measure?
6498,3_technical,2_copyedit,"So you injected 0.1 ml, but that is not the concentration. I believe the concentration was 1 mM"
6499,2_writing,3_general,Try to avoid colloquial language. Fix this throughout your report as well
6500,2_writing,3_general,Writing flow reads robotically
6501,2_writing,4_specific,"I’m confused by this sentence, what do you mean before they were treated with lidocaine there was a difference?"
6502,3_technical,3_general,No reason to use 0.1 significance level. Just use 0.05 for everything
6503,3_technical,2_copyedit,Units
6504,3_technical,2_copyedit,What do your error bars represent? Standard deviation or error? It should be standard error but be sure to include it in your figure legend
6505,3_technical,4_specific,"Did you just record the data from one fish, or both?"
6506,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?
6507,2_writing,4_specific,Reasoning goes into discussion.
6508,2_writing,4_specific,"Is this information necessary in the Introduction? Your la report should include the biological hypothesis, but these are the null and alternative hypothesis for the statistical analysis. Are those the same? Check the BioCore Guide for the differences between biological and statistical hypothesis"
6509,4_logic,3_general,Briefly mention what was the result. What did you get that is supporting the hypothesis
6510,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much of each?
6511,2_writing,3_general,"Great content in this intro, but you can still improve stylistically. You have a few run-on sentences in here and your tone seems forced. The best science writing is simple, concise, and able to be understood by anyone."
6512,4_logic,4_specific,"What’s the connection between climate change and your experiment? Be more specific. What you have in your abstract seems good, so weave that in here."
6513,2_writing,4_specific,Yes! This is what should go in the methods.
6514,3_technical,2_copyedit,What was the name of your blocker?
6515,3_technical,4_specific,What was the comparison for this statistical result?
6516,3_technical,2_copyedit,square
6517,3_technical,4_specific,Wait. I’m not sure what ATPase activity has to do with actin and myosin. This is where having that bio background in the intro is useful
6518,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t need this
6519,3_technical,4_specific,What groups were compared? What were your alpha and CI levels?
6520,3_technical,2_copyedit,"When reporting the results of a two-sample t-test, you need to include the resulting t-statistic, the degrees of freedom (df), and the corresponding P-value. Your statement might look like this, “The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.57, df = 26, P = 0.574).”"
6521,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what temp?
6522,2_writing,3_general,Try to be more concise and clear in this section. Could you say the same info in 3-4 sentences? Be sure to refer to your figures
6523,2_writing,6_holistic,Informal. Revise to make it formal. Use your best judgement to locate other informal/colloquial terms/texts/formats used elsewhere in the report and revise accordingly.
6524,3_technical,2_copyedit,It looks like you didn’t change either of these graphs from the first time around
6525,3_technical,4_specific,This could be confusing; the reader can understand that you have a treatment and control group with different legs
6526,4_logic,4_specific,"Also, this is not the only explanation. The issue could be with the way this CCB works, rather than with the role of calcium in the muscle contraction."
6527,1_basic,4_specific,"Don’t state this, don’t mention the hypothesis until the discussion"
6528,3_technical,4_specific,Which studies? Cite them.
6529,3_technical,4_specific,Make sure your error bars are representing each groups standard deviation
6530,3_technical,2_copyedit,You should not have a title in the body of the figure
6531,3_technical,2_copyedit,Total mass?
6532,3_technical,3_general,Refer people to your figures
6533,3_technical,2_copyedit,The citation format for the lab manual is [Johnson : 2018]. Make sure all your other citations have brackets and not parentheses
6534,3_technical,4_specific,Why are you talking about weight?
6535,2_writing,3_general,This can be said without referring to tube labels
6536,2_writing,4_specific,"You don’t need this, this is methods"
6537,2_writing,2_copyedit,Were treated as a control would be a better way to put it
6538,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
6539,3_technical,2_copyedit,Not significantly different
6540,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t start with what you are doing. Introductions should start broad and then whittle down to your own experiment. So start explaining muscle contraction, mention the species of interest and why it is helpful, and then get into what you will do in general terms and what you think will happen"
6541,3_technical,6_holistic,"Ah, interesting. So what is it related to instead?"
6542,3_technical,2_copyedit,Year?
6543,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Also, just have your y-axis say “Twitch Threshold”, because just saying current is a bit confusing."
6544,1_basic,4_specific,"You should include your p-value in your results, even though you won’t talk about what it means for the hypothesis until the discussion section."
6545,4_logic,3_general,That is not what the data represents.
6546,3_technical,2_copyedit,Reference the figure showing these results
6547,2_writing,4_specific,You need some background on the Manduca sexta and what ecdysone normally does in the body
6548,3_technical,4_specific,"Not for length, right? The result is not statistically significant."
6549,3_technical,2_copyedit,Still no title
6550,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data and should not be included
6551,3_technical,2_copyedit,Be sure to include the statistics at the end of the caption as well.
6552,3_technical,3_general,I need to see these numbers in the results.
6553,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t list these out, try to make it a sentence/paragraph form"
6554,3_technical,4_specific,Why is this a good species to study?
6555,3_technical,3_general,Refer to figures in the results
6556,3_technical,4_specific,Why’d you want these pellets?
6557,2_writing,4_specific,Need a little more background info here about color. Briefly discuss/speculate about why color affected one of your dependent variables but not the other
6558,3_technical,2_copyedit,There should not be a title in the body of the graph.
6559,3_technical,2_copyedit,Significant?
6560,3_technical,2_copyedit,Use correct citation rule
6561,3_technical,4_specific,Things to includeThe chemical used: AchE inhibitorThe studied muscle: gastrocnemius muscleThe species name: Rana pipiensWhat did you analyze?
6562,3_technical,4_specific,"Myograms are the representation of contraction, so you did not use a myogram"
6563,3_technical,4_specific,You should mention here the statistical test used to analyze the data.
6564,4_logic,2_copyedit,I would include some version of your hypothesis early on in the abstract so people understand what you expected to happen when you start discussing the results later.
6565,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
6566,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?
6567,2_writing,4_specific,"Avoid stating stat results in abstract. Alternatively, you can say that your herbicide did not significantly decrease photosynthesis which was supported by your t-test analysis."
6568,2_writing,4_specific,Heavier than what?
6569,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?
6570,3_technical,4_specific,Which statistical test did you use?
6571,3_technical,4_specific,"In your graph, you showed that the experimental groups ate less but grew more."
6572,3_technical,4_specific,"Technically, two (one above the mean, one below)"
6573,3_technical,2_copyedit,"The correct citation format is [author : year]. Also, this is a website, not a scientific article, and so if not a primary source"

6577,3_technical,4_specific,"Where’s your treatment bar, lol?"
6578,4_logic,4_specific,Your hypothesis was only partially supported because the quantitative data did not support the hypothesis
6579,3_technical,4_specific,What about R:S for weight? I only see lengths here and your methods say that you also measured weights. Please include both.
6580,3_technical,4_specific,Is this supposed to be here? Or is this part of your figure caption? What are the standard deviations?
6581,3_technical,4_specific,This is not a primary/peer reviewed source
6582,3_technical,4_specific,"You say there is a statistical significance, but these p-values are not significant. Which is true?"
6583,4_logic,4_specific,"I would say that these errors likely did not interfere with your experimental results, not that they didn’t occur, otherwise it’s a little pointless to talk about them"
6584,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Look at years. Sometime at the end, and others at the beginning. Format should be uniform."
6585,3_technical,3_general,Not necessary. Figures are considered to be their own section.
6586,3_technical,4_specific,Why didn’t you average
6587,3_technical,2_copyedit,sativa?
6588,2_writing,4_specific,You need to start much broader. What are the biological concepts in which we are interested? What is their importance? Why did we choose betta fish as our model species? Why is your treatment relevant?
6589,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Reduce your significant digits, same for t-value"
6590,2_writing,2_copyedit,There’s always some uncertainties in science and words such as “prove” and “correct” should be avoided.
6591,3_technical,8_nobasis,Which one?
6592,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t need this
6593,3_technical,8_nobasis,This increase the variability in your experimental group

6595,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
6596,3_technical,4_specific,According to your formula (before - after treatment) this value should be positive because the contraction was stronger before the injection. So correct this.

6613,3_technical,2_copyedit,Delete gridlines
6614,3_technical,4_specific,Good job finding this reference. But would be better to find some references about how color affects mate choice specifically. Even if it’s about other species

6616,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
6617,3_technical,3_general,Can you include more details for a better understanding of the figure? Remember that figure captions should be self-explanatory.
6618,3_technical,4_specific,I’m confused here. (Interpreting data)
6619,3_technical,4_specific,These need standard deviations
6620,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t need this sentence.

6622,3_technical,2_copyedit,At 27C
6623,3_technical,4_specific,"Figure captions should be self-explanatory. You could be more precise about the measured variable (amplitude of contraction in response to threshold stimuli). You could also specify the tested muscle and the frog species, that will be more precise than just saying frog legs"
6624,2_writing,3_general,I see it now.
6625,4_logic,6_holistic,Can you really conclude that there is no change? What if something just went wrong? There’s a lot of literature out there stating the opposite…
6626,3_technical,4_specific,Are you sure? Remember that you exposed the sciatic between the tight muscles.
6627,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting

6637,2_writing,4_specific,"Can you think of a more descriptive way to word this? Expression applies to genes, but isn’t an informative way to think about plant growth."
6638,3_technical,2_copyedit,If you ran stats you should have results that state something
6639,4_logic,3_general,This needs to be backed up by past research results.
6640,3_technical,4_specific,This would be measured by the peak amplitude not by threshold.
6641,3_technical,4_specific,Can you be more precise? What did you average?

6667,3_technical,4_specific,You can probably leave this for the discussion and just state the p-value here in the results.
6668,3_technical,3_general,Can you be more specific? That doesn’t give any idea about the performed experiment. Things you could include.The chemical used: AchE inhibitorThe studied muscle: gastrocnemius muscleThe species name: Rana pipiens
6669,3_technical,4_specific,Did you mean were not statistically significant and the difference were obtained by chance? Then you should rewrite that part.
6670,2_writing,3_general,Revise this statement.

6677,3_technical,2_copyedit,Two-tailed two-sample t test
6678,3_technical,4_specific,Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.
6679,4_logic,6_holistic,How does sand vs soil connect to changing climates? Keep your big picture argument consistent throughout – in the discussion you talk more about food scarce regions. Can you tie all of these together somehow into a more coherent argument?
6680,2_writing,8_nobasis,What does this mean?
6681,3_technical,4_specific,This observation is an indicator of tetany. You could use this to mention that the muscle experimented tetanus after the injection of caffeine.
6682,3_technical,4_specific,"Again, what we labeled the tubes isn’t important"
6683,3_technical,2_copyedit,"How did you calculate this? They could be right, but your error bars look like you just used the default option in Excel or Google sheets, both of which are wrong."
6684,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is not what you stated your hypothesis was in your abstract
6685,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Use brackets [], not parentheses ()"

6687,4_logic,4_specific,Make sure you tie your results back to the big picture
6688,3_technical,2_copyedit,Provide molarity specifications for test compound solutions instead
6689,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data. Not needed
6690,3_technical,4_specific,This p-value suggests that the results are not significant and so your hypothesis is not supported

6707,2_writing,3_general,informal
6708,3_technical,4_specific,Make a new graph comparing control vs treatment means. Make sure your results reflect change in weight and not the final weight. This is necessary because your caterpillars started with different masses.

6716,3_technical,4_specific,I’d like to see a primary literature source here to justify this for spinach.
6717,3_technical,4_specific,These are not the results. That looks like figure captions. You should describe here the main observations from the graphs and the table. The tendencies.

6736,3_technical,2_copyedit,These averages need units and +/- standard deviations.
6737,3_technical,4_specific,That’s a bold claim. Citation?
6738,3_technical,6_holistic,"Avoid. Statistics calculate the probability it happened by chance. As such, 0.04 is still a 4% chance it was due to chance. It’s just unlikely that it was by chance"
6739,1_basic,3_general,You need a form of primary literature in your discussion section

6765,3_technical,2_copyedit,Remember to start your caption with the figure number and title (“Figure 1. Average Weight of Caterpillars in …”)
6766,1_basic,3_general,Your interpretation of the stats is still incorrect here. This looks identical to your first submission
6767,2_writing,3_general,Your abstract should be a summary of your whole report which means stating your averages/standard devs and your stats. Make sure the reader finishes your abstract and knows exactly what you found
6768,3_technical,4_specific,"Check the x-axis, it is not right. You can be more precise with the y-axis. What is the variable that you measured for this graph? The whiskers look very similar. Were the SD similar? If not, there is a problem"

For example, all the procedure to isolate 200 ul into microtubes with labels A, B, B pellet, and C can be condensed in a single line stating that the sample containing the pellet after second centrifuge was used.

7116,3_technical,4_specific,The reason for the equation/connection to the hypothesis is still unclear.
7117,4_logic,6_holistic,This looks like a second hypothesis statement and now I’m confused about which one you are interested in. Are they mutually exclusive? Could both be true? Could this intro be structured better to help me understand them?

7164,3_technical,1_pointer,1 and 2 what?
7165,3_technical,4_specific,You could report the statistics outcome at the end of the previous sentence. It is unnecessary an entire sentence just to report the p-value and say that there was not statistical significance.

7179,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
7180,3_technical,2_copyedit,No need to re-state the results here

7212,4_logic,4_specific,I would cite this previous study.
7213,3_technical,4_specific,"You misinterpreted your p-values here. Remember, p-values boil down to the probability that the observed results occurred due to chance (unofficial definition, but it helps to think about it this way)."
7214,2_writing,3_general,Do not quote previous studies. Explain their observations with your own words

7226,2_writing,4_specific,"This was a very well-written and organized introduction! It is a too long, though; try to look at what you might be able to cut, since one of the aims of scientific writing is conciseness; for example, info on the light-independent reactions isn’t totally pertinent to your investigation. Caveat: I would also add why you used spinach and kale specifically."
7227,4_logic,3_general,Tie this to a bigger issue.
7228,3_technical,4_specific,Why? What’s in this pellet?
7229,2_writing,3_general,this is probably a little too broad – more focused intro sentence

7238,3_technical,4_specific,define that this is what you considered threshold
7239,3_technical,4_specific,What does this number provide you information wise? It is strange that the standard deviation is almost 10 times as large as the average. Maybe rethink how you report this if at all

7250,3_technical,4_specific,"I don’t mind the day by day observations, but it is getting close to raw data.  If you want to use the visual observations in your discussion, just include (in the results) the specifics that you want to refence later rather then including everything"
7251,3_technical,4_specific,I would say JH analogue. And what does JH normally do in the caterpillar?
7252,2_writing,4_specific,You need to start broader. What is the underlying biological concept we are exploring? Why is it important? What does it tell us about plant fitness?
7253,3_technical,4_specific,"There’s a lot wrong in the figures, you need to report summarized data not raw data and I don’t need the tables of the statistics, just talk about the relevant ones in the figure caption/results section/discussion."
7254,3_technical,4_specific,"You don’t need a table and a graph, especially because they show the same information. I would just include the graph."
7255,3_technical,4_specific,Need to have references here about why you studied the effects of color. Find papers about effects of color in other species
7256,3_technical,4_specific,What means?  Mean of weight? Length?
7257,3_technical,6_holistic,"Instead of stating you t-values and p-values separately, you can actually arrange it better. Of all the statistically insignificant results, pick the ones that caught your attention, preferably the ones that you stressed on your discussion section and state it here in a concise way. For example, let’s pick 10% detergent compared to control (no detergent. Since all the values were insignificant throughout your record time, pick the 30 min value and write it as “The treatment of Spinach with 10% detergent with respect to control was not statistically insignificant (state your 30 min t-stat value, degreed of freedom, state your p-value) as shown in Figure x.

7261,3_technical,3_general,No need to list materials. You can simply mention them as they come up in the procedure.
7262,4_logic,4_specific,"If there was no significant difference, was your hypothesis really supported?"
7263,3_technical,4_specific,Several things: Your first table is not really necessary as you don’t mention it in your results.
7264,1_basic,3_general,Outside sources missing (basic criteria)
7265,3_technical,4_specific,According to your formula (before - after treatment) this value should be positive because the contraction was stronger before the injection. So correct this.
7266,2_writing,3_general,This is unclear
7267,4_logic,6_holistic,Why’d you use kale?! You mentioned C3 plants…what’s special about kale?
7268,3_technical,4_specific,I think you are misinterpreting a little bit. The stats say that the weights were not significantly different. Read up on stats in the core resource guide and see what that means.
7269,4_logic,4_specific,Make sure you tie your results back to the big picture
7270,3_technical,4_specific,These tables are not needed because the graphs show this data.
7271,2_writing,4_specific,"While this can be important to certain studies where disposal is difficult, I would leave this out as freezing biological parts for disposal is common practice."
7272,1_basic,4_specific,"This discussion is far too short, does not contain citations of primary literature (which are required in intro AND discussion), and does not clearly establish at the beginning whether or not the hypothesis was supported."
7273,2_writing,4_specific,"not necessary, remove throughout the paper – readers will assume you labeled things correctly"
7274,3_technical,2_copyedit,this shouldn’t go in-text citation

7277,3_technical,3_general,You should not display the same information in a table and a graph
7278,3_technical,3_general,You need to revisit this figure because something is wrong
7279,3_technical,3_general,Remove p values from discussion

7281,3_technical,3_general,"The table doesn’t exist in this report. There shouldn’t be a table anyway, include what would’ve been in your table into your methods section directly"

7283,4_logic,4_specific,How does molting relate to silkworm silk?
7284,3_technical,3_general,Refer to by specific figure numbers. Never reference by position in a report.
7285,3_technical,4_specific,Is this true? Provide some citation to back up your claims.
7286,4_logic,3_general,"You don’t need to re-hash your p-values, they are already in the results section. Instead just say there was a sig difference in the weight ratios, but not in light, and tell me what you think that means or why that happened."

7293,2_writing,2_copyedit,Word choice?
7294,4_logic,4_specific,You need to connect this claim specifically to the decrease in aggression exhibited by the bettas. Solid discussion

7323,3_technical,4_specific,"You can write that error bars represent +/- one standard deviation. Also I didn’t realize this the first time but your standard deviation bars look very similar to each other, so I’m not 100% sure they are correct"
7324,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not really consider a threshold
7325,3_technical,4_specific,"Also These graphs both say Experimental Group on the x axis.  This data is not a good choice to show in a figure because you don’t have any data for the tetany.  Instead of showing a graph, show a figure which can be a photo, a diagram, things like that.  It will need a caption but the in depth description of the figure could be put in the intro/discussion based on what you choose.For example:  you could show a diagram of a myogram of normal contraction and of tetany and use it to explain what happened to the leg.  This would count as a figure and would be a strong addition to the paper."
7326,2_writing,2_copyedit,Don’t need this but should include this in paragraph form in your results. Same with the Weight one.
7327,1_basic,4_specific,Do not try to interpret or discuss your data just yet.
7328,3_technical,4_specific,How many droplets per caterpillar? Your description is confusing.
7329,2_writing,4_specific,You need to introduce R:S and its relationship with resource allocation
7330,3_technical,4_specific,"Insignificant difference means that you saw no effective difference in R:S, so your hypothesis can not have been supported"
7331,3_technical,2_copyedit,Quantify this in mL
7332,3_technical,2_copyedit,What is the dilution?
7333,3_technical,3_general,Missing statistical analysis
7334,4_logic,3_general,Your discussion should say clearly near the beginning whether or not your hypothesis was supported.
7335,3_technical,4_specific,"No need to discuss difference among plants within each pot, because you aren’t showing those raw data"
7336,3_technical,2_copyedit,0.05
7337,2_writing,4_specific,These details are in your methods and don’t need to be repeated here.
7338,3_technical,2_copyedit,remove p values
7339,2_writing,4_specific,You need methods in your abstract and need to tie your results back to the big picture
7340,2_writing,4_specific,Briefly mention the main results in the Abstract
7341,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
7342,3_technical,3_general,Remove this throughout the method – it is not necessary to tell the reader how you labeled tubes
7343,2_writing,4_specific,You should not mention habituation in your intro unless your experiment is about habituation
7344,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Careful, you can’t do two things last"
7345,2_writing,2_copyedit,Unnecessary
7346,2_writing,3_general,Redundance. You can actually get rid of these lines.
7347,3_technical,4_specific,"This section is still far too long, and discusses anecdotes instead of quantitative data."
7348,2_writing,4_specific,Add a sentence about why this research matters.
7349,2_writing,4_specific,"Not sure that this is technically primary literature, although you can use the info from it as a secondary source (like the lab manual)."
7350,3_technical,2_copyedit,You don’t need a citation to explain a fraction
7351,3_technical,4_specific,"Clean this up, you can use numbers also report your averages and standard devs for each group."
7352,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t use quotations, just paraphrase."
7353,3_technical,6_holistic,"Are they really maintaining homeostasis? Remember, fish are ectothermic, so they do not regulate their temperature"
7354,3_technical,4_specific,Give a more numerical summary of your results.
7355,3_technical,4_specific,Use more descriptive labels than control and experimental
7356,2_writing,2_copyedit,But only one is cited
7357,4_logic,4_specific,"It’s not their weight that makes them unable to move on, it’s the level of JH"
7358,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Delete this, but do include the ANOVA test results as a figure/table"
7359,3_technical,3_general,This is not the title of a lab report. That is the title of the unit. The title should give information about the experiment that you did.
7360,4_logic,3_general,"Those were the obtained results, but that doesn’t mean the experiment was not successful."
7361,3_technical,4_specific,"No need to include a URL with journal articles. These online/website guidelines are for info originally published on a website, not journal articles that happen to be available online."
7362,2_writing,4_specific,Hypothesis comes before methods
7363,2_writing,4_specific,What was the hypothesis? The hypothesis of the experiment should be included in the Abstract.
7364,3_technical,4_specific,"No need to show the same data in a table and in a figure. An easier way to do this would be to just have a separate graph for each dependent variable, and 2 columns per graph."
7365,2_writing,2_copyedit,Figure 1:
7366,4_logic,6_holistic,"This is a pretty good start to your introduction, but it doesn’t tell me anything about what previous studies looking at salinity in particular have found. Look for that research and integrate it into your intro to contextualize your experiment and hypothesis."
7367,3_technical,4_specific,You should mention this after you describe the observed result
7368,3_technical,4_specific,"When all are diminished? You need to explain exactly what energy allocation entails, and what causes it to change."
7369,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviation?
7370,2_writing,4_specific,It would be helpful to have a short description of plant resource allocation before you jump right into talking about root:shoot ratios.
7371,4_logic,2_copyedit,Include a sentence about why you think this happened.
7372,2_writing,4_specific,"Your intro jumps back and forth between murky water, then aggressive behaviors, then back to murky water again. Rearrange it so that it flows more logically into your hypothesis."
7373,2_writing,4_specific,Be more precise here and explain the mechanism– the plants vary their own resource allocation in response to these factors.
7374,3_technical,4_specific,Did you compare the mean distances?
7375,3_technical,4_specific,"Good caption, but you should not show raw data. Just show average aggression score"
7376,2_writing,2_copyedit,Biology Department might be better
7377,3_technical,4_specific,Units of y-axis
7378,3_technical,3_general,Check in the annotation exercise how to report the statistics outcome in the results.
7379,3_technical,4_specific,Clarify that it is suspended from a force transducer
7380,4_logic,3_general,Can you emphasize that this is the hypothesis of the present study?
7381,4_logic,6_holistic,Why? What changes in metabolism or photosynthesis happen with limited light spectrum?
7382,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs in the methods section
7383,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I know it seems silly, but you should specifically say that the difference was not significant."
7384,3_technical,4_specific,Is this chance in duration or average duration of control?
7385,2_writing,3_general,This reads rushed. Please put more thought into this.
7386,2_writing,4_specific,"So…this isn’t a bad title at all, but you do want something that’s going to make people want to read your paper, and inconclusive isn’t enticing."
7387,2_writing,4_specific,"Again, more information needs to go here. This would be almost acceptable for a lab notebook entry, but not for a lab report."
7388,3_technical,4_specific,"This caption for Figure 3 needs the title of the figure, description of what it shows (if not in the title) and explanation of what the error bars represent. Figure 2 also needs a title if you include it."
7389,4_logic,3_general,Do not assume that you did it wrong! Why do you think that there were errors? Only include errors if you are sure that there were errors and they were affecting the results.
7390,3_technical,4_specific,"Would be good to show a separate graph for each of the dependent variables, then not show this table. See me if you need help with the graphs and stats"
7391,3_technical,3_general,Wrong citation format (see the resource guide)
7392,3_technical,4_specific,This needs citation
7393,1_basic,4_specific,You still didn’t state whether or not your hypothesis was supported. :( I mentioned this on Sakai!
7394,3_technical,4_specific,"You should clearly say that the error bars represent +/- 1 standard deviation. Your graph also needs an x-axis, and the labels of “average” in the upper left and right don’t actually tell us anything useful."
7395,4_logic,4_specific,Does this necessarily change resource allocation though?
7396,2_writing,4_specific,"Restructure your introduction so it flows better. Start by broadly talking about resource allocation, then effects of salinity (you have good background sources here!) and then your specific hypothesis. What you have right now lacks a logical flow."
7397,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is redundant
7398,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to summarize these data with just 3 bars, instead of bars for every single female."
7399,3_technical,3_general,Missing citations
7400,3_technical,4_specific,Which conditions? Partial spectrum? Availability?
7401,2_writing,2_copyedit,You have included wrong text!
7402,3_technical,2_copyedit,Do not use a table just for the statistical output
7403,3_technical,4_specific,Need to state which statistical test you did
7404,4_logic,1_pointer,interpret ???
7405,3_technical,4_specific,"This figure title is not very descriptive. Also, there are no labels on your x-axis at all and the colored blocks in the legend are not labeled, meaning they are not actually useful."
7406,3_technical,4_specific,The metamorphosis is more related to the transition from the larval phase to an adult phase through the pupa stage.
7407,3_technical,4_specific,t-value? We only care about the p-value (which cannot be above 1)
7408,2_writing,4_specific,You don’t need to completely restate your results in the discussion. Focus on explaining the results in the context of the costs and benefits of aggression
7409,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can use et al after the first author last name because that article has more than 2 authors
7410,2_writing,4_specific,This could go in the results
7411,3_technical,3_general,You should not mention the null hypothesis in a lab report
7412,3_technical,3_general,In-text citations should be according to resource guide/as shown in the resource guide quiz.
7413,3_technical,3_general,This is a scientific paper. Check the BioCore Guide (page 48-49) for the citations formatting.
7414,2_writing,3_general,Do not quote previous studies.
7415,2_writing,3_general,"Make sure your discussion progresses logically, you may need to reorganize this. Also work on redundancy, try to be concise in your explanations and guesses"

7427,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can put your p-value in parentheses here)
7428,3_technical,4_specific,"You are missing too many important details. That is not an explanation of the experiment. The idea of this section is that someone could repeat the experiment based on this information. Do you think that is possible just reading your methods? Missing: specimen preparation, experimental procedure specifying the stimuli and data acquisition, measured variables, statistical analysis"
7429,4_logic,3_general,Why do we care about this research?
7430,4_logic,4_specific,"You say the experiment is important for understanding links between behavior and fitness, yet the example you give here doesn’t say anything about fitness. Can you be more specific? Are you saying that bettas in murky water might be more fit than their clear water counterparts? Or that the decreased aggression might lead to higher fitness? Please expand."
7431,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the tukey sig difference in parenthesis at the end of previous statement and get rid of this statement.
7432,3_technical,2_copyedit,What was the concentration?
7433,3_technical,4_specific,"You graph needs to have 2 columns, showing the average of the pot averages. Also needs to have error bars. See me for help with making graphs."
7434,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way)."
7435,2_writing,3_general,Rule of thumb is to spell out numbers that are less than 10 (or any number that starts a sentence unless it’s a volume)
7436,3_technical,4_specific,Indicate that you used this formula to convert your raw data (which is your absorbance data)
7437,3_technical,4_specific,"As the graph above and below already displays this data and we aren’t as interested in the exact values as we are in the overall differences, I would exclude this chart."
7438,3_technical,3_general,We can work on why this graph looks a little strange but you have everything in it you need.
7439,2_writing,4_specific,Give some indication of the results here. Does/does not affect
7440,2_writing,4_specific,This needs to be in your introduction section
7441,3_technical,3_general,"In future, you’ll also want y-axis labels (units). I didn’t mention this last time, so I’m not penalizing you for missing it here."
7442,3_technical,4_specific,All of this should be saved for the discussion.  It talks to much about why you did things rather than the cold results.
7443,3_technical,4_specific,"In addition, a table for statistical tests isn’t needed. You only need to say which test you used in the methods and your p-value in your results/discussion."
7444,3_technical,3_general,Avoid using a whole sentence to only report the p-value. Statistic outcomes could be reported with the direct observation.
7445,2_writing,2_copyedit,Growth of what? Roots? Shoots?
7446,3_technical,4_specific,you actually centrifuged them to isolate the chloroplasts in your current procedure. You should have indicated how you would improve the current procedure to design an effective method
7447,3_technical,4_specific,What temperature does he recommend? Is it around room temperature? If so this doesn’t really apply
7448,3_technical,4_specific,You also don’t need to include your statistics in a table here because you already stated them in your results
7449,4_logic,4_specific,You state a different hypothesis in your introduction. Make sure you’re consistent!
7450,3_technical,4_specific,You can bring this up at the end of each paragraph and talk about the respective t-test results.

7462,3_technical,2_copyedit,Too many digits. Round this
7463,4_logic,3_general,Support with literature
7464,3_technical,4_specific,"No need to show the same data in the table and in figures. The figures should just have 2 columns for each dependent variable, with the averages of the pot averages. No need to show the different values of each pot, since that’s not what you did your stats on"
7465,2_writing,3_general,Your discussion improved a little but you still didn’t really flesh out your primary literature and I wanted a little more biological significance/explanation
7466,2_writing,3_general,"Don’t need to use quotations, just paraphrase the article"
7467,3_technical,4_specific,It’s unclear which color corresponds to which treatment. Need much more description in the figure captions
7468,3_technical,4_specific,This is where Tukey-Kramer comes in.
7469,4_logic,4_specific,Why? What’s the underlying mechanism?
7470,3_technical,2_copyedit,You need to cite this!
7471,3_technical,4_specific,The p-value is the probability that the given results are due to chance
7472,4_logic,4_specific,"I want more.  Connect that (more) biological background to why an alkaline pH specifically could disrupt photosynthesis, because I don’t think your hypothesis is quite supported yet. Otherwise, good intro!"
7473,3_technical,4_specific,"Did you quantify this and do you have the data to back it up? If not, don’t present it as a fact. Present it as an observation."
7474,2_writing,2_copyedit,Modify this one based on the previous
7475,3_technical,4_specific,Be sure to refer to figures here ….e.g.  “blue was not greater than clear (Figure 1).”Make sure to report the results for both dependent variables. Give a separate p value for mass and for R:S

7477,2_writing,2_copyedit,Can you be more precise?
7478,3_technical,4_specific,Which t-test did you use?

7481,3_technical,4_specific,What was the basic diet?
7482,2_writing,2_copyedit,"This should definitely come earlier in the discussion before you talk about errors, as this is a great explanation for why your results occurred, so I would talk more about this. Also, end your discussion with a concluding sentence"
7483,3_technical,4_specific,Mention the molarity of test compound. Mention calculations and preparations related to 1x to 20x dilutions of test compound and prep steps for your treatment plates
7484,4_logic,6_holistic,It’s more about cost benefit. Plants have to prioritize collecting scarce resources so they can perform photosynthesis and other cell functions (think of limiting reactants in chemical rxns).
7485,2_writing,6_holistic,Start more broadly. What are the important underlying biological concepts?

7488,2_writing,1_pointer,???
7489,3_technical,2_copyedit,it’s a little difficult to read this with all the colors being so different. Is it possible to get all treatment groups to be one color and all controls to be another?
7490,4_logic,6_holistic,You could do this and show it as a result. Why didn’t you do it?
7491,3_technical,3_general,"Report the results of your t-test properly, as noted in the resource guide"

7517,4_logic,2_copyedit,What was your hypothesis. Make it its own sentence (near the beginning of the abstract).
7518,2_writing,4_specific,I would mention this earlier so the reader has a nice flow and understands why you expect potassium channel blocker would have an effect on muscle contraction as soon as you talk about blockers.
7519,3_technical,2_copyedit,“Prepare PDA plates by strictly adhering to preparation protocol” would be a better way to put it

7532,2_writing,4_specific,Good point to end on. I would suggest expanding on this importance in your own words so that you don’t end on a citation (someone else’s thoughts).
7533,2_writing,4_specific,"Remember, an abstract follows the same format as your overall study. Is this the broadest concept?"

7566,3_technical,4_specific,This is known the moment you say the p-value.  Use this sentence to sum up your discussion instead.
7567,3_technical,3_general,"For your list of Literature Cited, use the one format. Do web links should be used for peer reviewed articles.Include the lab manual"
7568,2_writing,2_copyedit,Hypothesize?
7569,2_writing,6_holistic,Be precise. Do not base your exlanations in feelings
7570,4_logic,2_copyedit,"I think this is your hypothesis. In that case, you cannot cite the hypothesis because that is the biological question of the present work, is not an observation from a previous study"
7571,4_logic,4_specific,"What is the connection between development and weight gain, if there is one?"
7572,3_technical,8_nobasis,Which one?
7573,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation format
7574,3_technical,3_general,Try looking for the active ingredient in Precor. It uses a JH analogue rather than JH itself.

7576,4_logic,4_specific,Talk more about what this study did and found
7577,4_logic,3_general,How is this related to your experiment? Does it explain your results? You need to explain how you can interpret your results based on their previous findings.

7581,1_basic,4_specific,Where is your hypothesis? (Basic Criteria)
7582,3_technical,4_specific,"How? Especially since you had contamination, you need to describe how you sterilized things."
7583,3_technical,2_copyedit,So you should’ve injected 0.1 ml of 1mM tubocurarine
7584,3_technical,2_copyedit,"What are the values between parenthesis the SD for of the variables for the control and experimental groups or both variables for one group? That is not clear just reading the text. Nonetheless, I would report the mean and SD together and then interpret those results"
7585,3_technical,4_specific,Combine this figures and create just figure caption
7586,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not sure this is the best verb. ‘Stimulated’ perhaps?
7587,3_technical,4_specific,So did you not run a statistical test? You should’ve done a two sample t-test to determine if the difference in weights between your two groups was significant
7588,3_technical,4_specific,"While the absorbance values are inversely proportional to photosynthesis activity, percent change is directly proportional. Throughout the discussion either pick absorbance value or percent change and refer to p-value."
7589,2_writing,3_general,"This abstract needs a little bit more in it. Think two sentences for intro, your hypothesis, one sentence for methods, two for results, and a short conclusion"
7590,3_technical,2_copyedit,Need to explain what the behaviors are
7591,3_technical,4_specific,"You could actually include dilution calc info, 1x1cm square info, how 2% water agar medium was prepared—all these in your reagent table."
7592,2_writing,4_specific,"You need a little more info on what ecdysterone specifically does, and how it related to weight of the caterpillars"
7593,3_technical,2_copyedit,I don’t think you uploaded this figure?
7594,3_technical,2_copyedit,"So this is the t-stat, it is more important to have a p-value in here"
7595,2_writing,2_copyedit,In what?Above you use ‘photosynthetic rates’  and below photosynthetic activity I would pick a term
7596,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report the SD with the mean value
7597,2_writing,4_specific,You can embed this into your experimental layout earlier in the methods—might flow better.

7599,3_technical,4_specific,Did you measure weight?
7600,3_technical,4_specific,"I still think you should do a Tukey-Kramer.  Because actually? The error bar looks significant to me, so…"
7601,4_logic,4_specific,I still don’t see that biological reasoning for pH affecting the light-dep. Reactions of photosynthesis.
7602,2_writing,1_pointer,Typo?
7603,3_technical,4_specific,"Ok, the way you have this organized is pretty confusing, because you’re going back and forth between two values for four legs. Talk about the threshold for all four legs first, then talk about contraction amplitude"
7604,3_technical,4_specific,Did you average distance migrated or calculate a rate and average that? Put that here!
7605,3_technical,4_specific,But you predicted a decrease in the threshold.
7606,2_writing,4_specific,This was not possible because the Achilles tendon was tied. Be careful with the cause-effect relations that you do.
7607,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would recommend a two-tailed t test (or a two-sample t-test)
7608,3_technical,4_specific,Its hard to compare the effect of treatment when each figure is a separate treatment. You should combine broadside and facing into a total aggressive score and then compare the mean and standard deviations of the total behavior by treatment. Your error bars are also formatted incorrectly in the second figure. Come see me if you need help with excel.
7609,4_logic,3_general,Why do you think your results may have been different from what you had expected and what would you recommend changing in future experiments?
7610,3_technical,4_specific,there is not a multiple variable t-test
7611,2_writing,3_general,Don’t put quotes in your lab report

7615,3_technical,4_specific,A brief (1-2 sentences) explanation for why the model organism was good to use in your experiment.
7616,3_technical,3_general,You should not have raw data in your lab report

7618,3_technical,3_general,Reference your figures in here to better explain what is going on.
7619,2_writing,3_general,Avoid repeating words
7620,2_writing,3_general,Need a little bit more background info about why this may be the case
7621,2_writing,3_general,Try to be a little more specific
7622,2_writing,4_specific,"You need a little bit more on why you think you would get that result, what effect does JH have on weight, what is the correlation there? Explain that throughout the introduction"
7623,4_logic,4_specific,"They did still contract though, so what exactly is going on?"
7624,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is a good graph.  Could increase the size of the legend some for ease in reading.

7627,3_technical,2_copyedit,pupa
7628,3_technical,4_specific,The overall average weight gain/loss with the standard deviation would be a bit more useful than just the standard deviation
7629,2_writing,3_general,Anything general enough to be used in the abstract doesn’t typically need citation.
7630,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, maybe it did grow toward food at the beginning but changed direction later.. the traces could actually be revealed against a light source.."
7631,3_technical,2_copyedit,I think this was a typo. It’s “50 mL centrifuge tubes”
7632,3_technical,4_specific,Combine these with the previous results
7633,1_basic,4_specific,Do not interpret data in the methods
7634,3_technical,2_copyedit,Is this part of the figure? The statistical comparison is not visualized in the figure
7635,2_writing,3_general,Revise
7636,4_logic,4_specific,In your intro you need to talk more about the biological things that happen what would be affected by caffeine
7637,4_logic,4_specific,Section too short. Analysis should be done regardless on experimental errors. Mistakes in data collection or monitoring had resulted in cool unintended discoveries.
7638,2_writing,3_general,Colloquial language
7639,3_technical,4_specific,Error bars represent?
7640,3_technical,3_general,Refer people to your figures in the results section.
7641,3_technical,8_nobasis,Then why you have Figure 1?

7645,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
7646,4_logic,4_specific,You shouldn’t reference another experiment if you are talking about your own here
7647,3_technical,4_specific,Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.
7648,2_writing,3_general,You just need to write a lot more than you did. Refer to the Biocore Resource Guide to see what is expected of each section and/or come talk to me about how you can improve.
7649,3_technical,2_copyedit,If none of them died you don’t need to state that
7650,3_technical,2_copyedit,Citation formatting
7651,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is not needed
7652,3_technical,2_copyedit,Stats?!
7653,3_technical,4_specific,did you use averages from each pot?
7654,3_technical,4_specific,Technically this is primary literature but you need to talk about what they did and what this study found and how it relates to your paper
7655,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure I can see the negative end of the standard error bars
7656,3_technical,2_copyedit,This figure is not necessary. Just include figures with your results.

7658,2_writing,3_general,Find a different way to phrase this so it is more concise
7659,3_technical,4_specific,Look out for plagiarism both in your intro and in your methods. Find other resources and/or make them into your own words to avoid this happening again. Breathe! We’ll fix this.
7660,3_technical,8_nobasis,"and that happens all the time, that is science! You don’t need to mention this"
7661,3_technical,4_specific,"You could include the p-values you stated at the top, here instead. Same for the statements about the avg. lengths."

7664,2_writing,1_pointer,typo
7665,2_writing,2_copyedit,Just say marginal
7666,3_technical,2_copyedit,Could you check this again? Your table has a different p-value
7667,3_technical,4_specific,Why are you interested in this?
7668,4_logic,3_general,"This is not true. Do not assume that you did the experiment wrong. There could be biological explanations, alternative hypothesis, etc. You cannot attribute the results to experimental errors."
7669,3_technical,2_copyedit,PTTH?
7670,3_technical,3_general,You need another source
7671,2_writing,4_specific,You are missing important information in this sectionSome background informationBriefly describe the methodologyThe hypothesis should be included also
7672,2_writing,2_copyedit,"You already said this, no need to say it again. Just jump right into the interpretation part."
7673,4_logic,3_general,"Also, I’d connect the dots—it might be easier to see a clear relationship here."
7674,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would include the number of pulses as well as the width used as well (the duration of the stimulus)

7681,2_writing,3_general,This disagrees with the first sentence of your results (which is in the wrong section).
7682,3_technical,4_specific,Need to include more in these figure captions. Need to include what the respective statistics values are as well as what the legend is in words.
7683,4_logic,3_general,"Again, think of a better flaw"
7684,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test was used? And your alpha value was not 0.005. Think about it and let me know if you still don’t know.
7685,4_logic,3_general,How does this relate to your study? You need to connect the dots for your reader
7686,4_logic,4_specific,Why? What support do you have for this?
7687,2_writing,3_general,Perhaps a little too broad
7688,3_technical,4_specific,Did you sterilize anything?
7689,2_writing,4_specific,Good abstract. Can you add a (half) sentence explaining why you made the hypothesis you did? (Maybe replace your first sentence with something about how calcium in important for muscle contraction)
7690,1_basic,4_specific,DO NOT DISCUSS THE HYPOTHESIS IN THE RESULTS!(We’ve repeatedly gone over this in class and I commented on it in your last lab report. Please come see me if you have questions.)
7691,3_technical,4_specific,This is unclear and doesn’t match your methods.
7692,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Not necessary (only your main hypothesis is needed in the intro)… also, “biological statistical hypothesis” is not a thing"
7693,4_logic,3_general,The goal is to “understand patterns/outcomes” not “prove”.
7694,2_writing,2_copyedit,"This sounds more like a prediction, but it’s phrased as a result. Revise please!"
7695,4_logic,3_general,"What evidence does this provide you for your own experiment, why is this study relevant. Make that clear because the connection seems confusing."
7696,4_logic,6_holistic,"Right, so can you take this a little further? What does it say about the evolution of these fish, and artificial selection in particular? It’s important to make this connection."

7703,3_technical,2_copyedit,"For statistical tests, you only need to state which test was used (in the methods) and your p-value (Results/discussion)"
7704,1_basic,4_specific,"This is interpretation, which goes in the discussion, not in the results."
7705,4_logic,3_general,No need to discuss sources of error unless you have evidence that it actually affected your results
7706,3_technical,4_specific,Do you think a picture would be helpful to visualize this results?
7707,2_writing,3_general,This is unclear
7708,3_technical,4_specific,"You need to describe here the trends of your graph. It is not enough just to mention that the statistic was not significant. Remember, statistics is just a tool, not the most important thing in your results."
7709,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you include the alpha value (0.05)

7712,3_technical,4_specific,A brief (1-2 sentences) explanation for why the model organism was good to use in your experiment.
7713,4_logic,6_holistic,You need to expand on this more. Why would increased weight and length be connected with increased JH?  It has to do with the commitment pulse but you need to say more about that.
7714,2_writing,2_copyedit,Hypothesize would be a better term
7715,3_technical,2_copyedit,Cut -off level for significance.

7726,2_writing,6_holistic,"What is better behavior?In general, the writing quality of this introduction needs to be improved. Your sentence structure is poor in some places, and the language is informal (e.g., “This is the fish at max aggression”).What about the fact that the native habitat of betta fish is murky (what you call opaque) water? How do you think that plays into the biology of these aggressive interactions? Why is it interesting or important to test on these aquarium fish?"
7727,2_writing,2_copyedit,You can combine these two sentences into one by just cutting out what I’ve highlighted
7728,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Also, add a concluding sentence"

The first sentence, for example, is pretty broad but doesn’t tell me much about biology or why we study behavior. Think about the links between evolution, behavior, and fitness, and then incorporate this idea of taking shelter into those concepts."
7777,4_logic,3_general,Getting results that do not support your hypothesis does not mean an error occurred in your experiment

7932,3_technical,3_general,"You should focus on the explanations and interpretations of the results, not possible errors."
7933,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
7934,2_writing,2_copyedit,Rewrite this result but avoid repeating the same words.
7935,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would exclude this as it can be considered raw data (Leaving in the portion in your results section about each leg decreasing in amplitude after injection is fine).

7957,1_basic,4_specific,"Do not say anything about your hypothesis in the results! This technically should cause this report to fail. I am going to just give you a warning since you missed the peer review when we discussed most of this, so you can still revise for full credit. Basically, you can mention your p-value in the results and you can say that it is or is not significant (since this is an objective statement based on the alpha level), but you should not say anything about your hypothesis (null or otherwise) until the discussion. Please let me know if you have any questions about this."
7958,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Logical, but we never use the word believe! Too subjective."

7970,3_technical,4_specific,"You tested more than one group (test and control groups,). Are they statistically different from one another?"
7971,2_writing,4_specific,you can mention this earlier when you talked about the IGR and its use as a pesticide.
7972,2_writing,6_holistic,"Much better with that biological background, but with the next lab report, focus on flow. The intro sounds a little disjointed, which is an okay starting point in that you’re essentially trying to make sure you hit every point, but it’s something to improve on going forward."
7973,2_writing,6_holistic,"Pretend you are writing a scientific journal article, not a lab notebook – avoid phrases like “in this experiment my group and I”Start your intro with a broad sentence introducing the topic (in this case, animal behavior). Then from there, explain about the betta fish and narrow down to your hypothesis. You have done this to some extent, but the first sentence here isn’t helping you connect your work to a broader concept in biology."
7974,3_technical,4_specific,Untrue because of your statistics. Your p-value indicates the weights of the two groups are not significantly different

7989,3_technical,4_specific,"These graphs are interesting but hard to read.  If all of the control 1 color and treatment were another, it would be a better graph to show."
7990,2_writing,2_copyedit,Rule of thumb: write out numbers if they’re less than 10

8007,3_technical,2_copyedit,UnitsAll the measurements require units!
8008,2_writing,3_general,You can condense this into one sentence in the future just summarizing it.
8009,3_technical,4_specific,What are you comparing to what? Mean absorbances? Mean percent change in absorbance?
8010,3_technical,4_specific,This is not true. JH controls the type of molt (either larval or adult)

8018,4_logic,4_specific,"Instead of thinking that three replicates were too small, think about the procedure of isolating the chloroplast. Maybe there weren’t enough chloroplast in the samples because they weren’t isolated properly. You mentioned about it in later sentences. Three replicates is a standard sample size so I wouldn’t say that it is too small."
8019,2_writing,6_holistic,More needs to go here. Remember the hour glass style of writing. Mechanistically what about photosynthesis is altered with temperature? Then what background supports that? Be sure to explain yourself.

8035,3_technical,4_specific,Also mention briefly what you will actually be doing in the experiment
8036,3_technical,3_general,You should reference your figures in this section when talking about your results from them
8037,3_technical,4_specific,So is your data significant or not?
8038,3_technical,4_specific,"Ok good, my only question is if your t-test values were the sum of the red manes for both fish in each interaction, or the individual values for a single fish?"
8039,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove this – this is not necessary; people will assume
8040,4_logic,3_general,"This is written like an Introduction. In this section, you should use previous studies to interpret the results."
8041,2_writing,4_specific,This is too much detail focusing on the methods. This statement should rather go in the methods section. I suggest to remove it and revise the previous line to convey the message.
8042,2_writing,2_copyedit,Not quite true
8043,3_technical,4_specific,Did you sterilize anything?
8044,4_logic,4_specific,Procedural error could be one reason. Maybe the chloroplasts were not successfully isolated. Recall that you did not actually look through the microscope and calculated relative chloroplast density this time. It could be error at maintaining the temp during the experiments. Explore possible reasons!
8045,3_technical,4_specific,"I’m really confused because there are so many figures. Try to get your data into one figure, and write a figure caption that explains the results from that figure."
8046,3_technical,4_specific,You should just state what the p-value is (no need to refer people to a table just to read the number).
8047,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include the statistics
8048,3_technical,2_copyedit,Should include the specific topic or cite the lab manual.
8049,3_technical,2_copyedit,What table? I only see figures!
8050,4_logic,2_copyedit,Wrap up with a bigger picture. So what does this mean for plant productivity? (or something along those lines)
8051,2_writing,2_copyedit,I would try to avoid “obviously” as it can seem demeaning to readers that did not arrive at this conclusion.
8052,2_writing,2_copyedit,You can get rid of this line.
8053,3_technical,4_specific,Reconsider the y-axisAmplitude of Contraction (V)
8054,3_technical,4_specific,"This statement lacks important information like the units, and of what averaged values these standard deviations were calculated."
8055,3_technical,4_specific,"Be specific… is it the data themselves that are not significant, or the differences between the two groups that are not significant?"
8056,3_technical,4_specific,What does this mean?Substrate typesSoil types
8057,3_technical,4_specific,Try to fix the x-axis label since you have –ve values.
8058,2_writing,3_general,Use background info from primary literature to support and back up your findings more
8059,4_logic,4_specific,You need to reorganize your intro a little. Start general and then talk about your experiment. Teach me about muscles and nerves first
8060,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what temperature?
8061,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what temp?
8062,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Didn’t notice this the first time around, but you don’t need the et al. in your citations"
8063,3_technical,4_specific,Did you follow up with a Tukey-Kramer to test your specific hypothesis that white light would promote the most photosynthesis?
8064,2_writing,3_general,Kind of reads colloquially. Try to avoid colloquial language
8065,2_writing,3_general,Colloquial
8066,3_technical,3_general,You should also reference your figures.
8067,3_technical,4_specific,Is calcium being blocked or is it’s receptor/channel being blocked?
8068,3_technical,4_specific,Reconsider the x-axis. Maybe using numbers for the days would be betterAre these averaged values? Where are the SD?
8069,3_technical,3_general,Please no URLs
8070,2_writing,2_copyedit,You don’t need so much detail here.
8071,2_writing,3_general,informal
8072,4_logic,4_specific,It’s still unclear what the female has to do with your experiment.
8073,3_technical,4_specific,"Don’t include the concentration of your chemical in the intro, include it in the methods"
8074,3_technical,4_specific,I don’t think you were stimulating the muscle for nearly long enough to cause fatigue

8077,3_technical,4_specific,You could be more specific. What is the process affected by Martin’s IGR?
8078,3_technical,2_copyedit,Need alpha value
8079,3_technical,2_copyedit,2% water agar
8080,2_writing,2_copyedit,Rewrite all this section. Why did you say that a statistical test must be done if you actually did it?
8081,2_writing,4_specific,You don’t need many details about the methods in this section. In the Abstract just summarize the most important things of the methods and that’s it.
8082,4_logic,4_specific,"For this type of hypothesis after the “if” you should mention what you would like to test (in this case, the effect of the Martin’s IGR on growth) and after the “then” your prediction."
8083,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?
8084,3_technical,4_specific,"This is a simplified way of seeing this process. The membrane potential is the result of the efflux of K+ ions and the small influx of Na+ ions, through the leak channels. The movement of this ions is passive and it is determined by the electrochemical gradients. Having more K+ inside the cell creates the chemical gradient for this ion, which facilitates the outflux of this ion. The outflux of positive charges causes the negative potential"
8085,3_technical,4_specific,Need to show the data and give the p value for both dependent variables you discuss
8086,3_technical,3_general,"Some comments I only marked once. For example, when I said to use the actual word “percentage” instead of the symbol “%,” be sure to apply it to the whole report."
8087,3_technical,2_copyedit,Hill reaction assay
8088,2_writing,2_copyedit,Nooo!!! We never prove things in science (no matter how hard we try…).
8089,3_technical,4_specific,This should be included in the results. Those are the main observations and that is part of the results.
8090,2_writing,2_copyedit,You already said this in the methods
8091,3_technical,4_specific,Which statistical test did you perform?
8092,3_technical,2_copyedit,Give the mL added to the food and the percent concentration
8093,3_technical,2_copyedit,How many?
8094,3_technical,3_general,This can be removed. A report rarely includes too much information about statistical tests other than what was used and the p-value obtained from it.
8095,3_technical,4_specific,Which leg?  During control or treatment?
8096,3_technical,4_specific,"You don’t need to mention the value because we can see that in the figure and you also mentioned in the text. However, if you still want to mention the mean, then it has to be accompanied by the standard deviation."
8097,3_technical,4_specific,Did I give you guys more data? Put the total number of frogs used for analysis here
8098,3_technical,3_general,You don’t need to include this statement about variables (I know the resource guide asks for it) if you don’t wish to.
8099,2_writing,4_specific,Make sure to include what you concluded (from your discussion).
8100,4_logic,3_general,No need to mention sources of error unless you have evidence that it actually affected the outcome

8107,2_writing,4_specific,"Revise to make it more formal. You can break them into smaller statements to convey the message clearly.""..not quite to the degree..."" is imprecise and unscientific. Consider ""but was not significant"" instead. Look for similar mistakes in the rest of the report and revise."
8108,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
8109,1_basic,3_general,Outside sources missing (Basic Criteria)
8110,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Avoid using “correct” as there is always some uncertainties in science. Your data may always have come from a reason separate from your original hypothesis. As such, I would say “supported”"
8111,3_technical,2_copyedit,Control would be a better word choice
8112,2_writing,3_general,"This is all slightly confusing, try to condense this into one cohesive thought"
8113,3_technical,2_copyedit,Specify the used chemical. Tubocurarine is not the only one.
8114,2_writing,4_specific,"Avoid saying “proved”. Data are never wrong or right…rather, they do or don’t “support” your hypothesis"
8115,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much of this did you inject?
8116,3_technical,3_general,Standard deviations? Mean and SD should be reported together.

8120,2_writing,4_specific,"First, give me a really simple sentence that gives me an idea of what signal transduction is and why it’s necessary for cells."
8121,2_writing,4_specific,"Summarize this, into one coherent and understandable sentence. Basically what did they add, what did it change, what result did they see (in simple terms)"
8122,4_logic,3_general,How is this related to your study?
8123,3_technical,4_specific,Y-axis labels and units are missing
8124,3_technical,4_specific,Missing y-axis. Is this the amplitude of the threshold or the amplitude of the contraction that was generated at the threshold?Specify the y-axis depending on that
8125,2_writing,2_copyedit,What is the main message with this idea? That information is already mentioned in the previous sentence.
8126,4_logic,4_specific,Your discussion should discuss a biological reason for your results – so what is going on inside the caterpillar
8127,3_technical,4_specific,Do not repeat phrases. You can elaborate the results more. Explaining each observation without using the same words. Statistical outcome? That should be part of the results.
8128,3_technical,2_copyedit,Improperly Formatted Error bars
8129,2_writing,4_specific,Not part of the introduction.
8130,3_technical,6_holistic,"Eclosion is a term more used in a different context. For example, the eggs eclosion and the adult eclosion from the pupa."
8131,2_writing,4_specific,This should go in Methods section. Error: Basic Criteria #2
8132,1_basic,3_general,"Your discussion is missing a lot of components including primary literature, make sure to check the core resource guide for what you need to add."
8133,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format

8135,3_technical,3_general,All the figures should be referenced in the text of the results.
8136,3_technical,2_copyedit,Not relevant to your methods
8137,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence got cut off…

8140,2_writing,3_general,Avoid repeating phrases
8141,3_technical,4_specific,"What data did you input into the t-test?  You said in your results that every leg experienced tetany, how could that be insignificant?"
8142,3_technical,4_specific,What is the muscle response? What did you measure? Be more specific
8143,2_writing,2_copyedit,These two sentences say the exact same thing – pick one.
8144,3_technical,4_specific,You could take a picture of this and include it in your next report! That would be really cool and would really add to your papers argument.
8145,4_logic,6_holistic,How? Does more JH allow for more or less reproductive success
8146,3_technical,2_copyedit,Just say there was no significant difference
8147,2_writing,4_specific,This is great! Just be sure to include your hypothesis somewhere in here
8148,2_writing,2_copyedit,Unnecessary
8149,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I would say “Martin’s IGR, a JH analogue”"
8150,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way)."
8151,2_writing,2_copyedit,The word smaller doesn’t make sense here because the treatment group was bigger than the control.
8152,3_technical,8_nobasis,What do you mean by this?
8153,3_technical,2_copyedit,Correlation means something specific in biology (statistics). So avoid saying correlation unless you’re doing that type of statistic
8154,2_writing,2_copyedit,This sentence is confusing
8155,2_writing,3_general,"This isn’t for plagiarizing. You do however just need to write a lot more than you did. Refer to the Biocore Resource Guide to see what is expected of each section and/or come talk to me about how you can improve. Don’t panic, we’ll fix this."

How injecting lidocaine--- Is not better just say lidocaineBiologically Significant in Its Effects --- What does this means? That is not preciseToo many words. Try to make your title shorter than 20 words. If you change those meaningless phrases, your title will be shorter and more precise"
8157,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Reference Figure 1, that information is displayed in that figure."
8158,2_writing,4_specific,Don’t you already state this in your first sentence?
8159,4_logic,4_specific,Can you relate this to the experiment? Try to explain why would you need more days of observations

8175,4_logic,4_specific,"What is the role of K+, you can consider mentioning the role here instead of saying what would happen if the channels are blocked. You should also mention why is the relaxation important. Why does a muscle cannot be contracted all time?"
8176,3_technical,4_specific,For which groups did these things occur?  Do you mean this happened to all the pillars?
8177,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I’m assuming SAWHET was just weird about the +/- symbol, but your numbers still do need units"
8178,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I would say you don’t really need three line graphs.  The graph with the average weights over time as fine, as you don’t really discuss specific individuals."

8182,3_technical,4_specific,"This is not primary, peer-reviewed literature"
8183,3_technical,4_specific,I would average all the values for controls together and the experimentals together and display this as a graph.
8184,3_technical,4_specific,It would still be better to build these graphs with just 1 series instead of 2. No need for the legend since you have x axis labels
8185,3_technical,4_specific,These are raw data; you should only include mean R:S data and SD. Figures also better represent data visually than do tables
8186,3_technical,4_specific,needs citation

8189,2_writing,3_general,Revise this statement to make it clearer.
8190,3_technical,4_specific,"This should be in the results section, like the rest of the observation, combined with the other sentence. Do not mention this like isolated observations. The key point here is to explain that there were differences in their coloration at the end of the experiment between groups."

Can you find a better source that actually talks about shelter? There are lots of fish that hide in coral reefs for shelter, for example.

8272,3_technical,4_specific,"Because I don’t think the contact between the nerve and the electrode would change inbetween recording the same leg (assuming you didn’t move the leg/electrode), this may have been a small amount of fatigue."
8273,3_technical,2_copyedit,What are the statistics?
8274,3_technical,4_specific,How can you support this statement? Statistical outcome! You could also refer to Table 1 here.
8275,3_technical,2_copyedit,"This image is also a figure, so you can call it such and rename your other figures."
8276,4_logic,4_specific,You never really talk about sand before your hypothesis. Make sure you introduce it as an inferior growing medium.
8277,2_writing,4_specific,Hypothesis comes before methods
8278,3_technical,3_general,"Your table is raw data, so I would get rid of it."
8279,3_technical,4_specific,What does this mean? You mean precor is a JH analogue?
8280,2_writing,4_specific,"Be more specific, this has a name"
8281,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure to include the concentration of lidocaine used.
8282,3_technical,2_copyedit,Isn’t this just the same as your first source?
8283,3_technical,4_specific,This p-value indication should have gone to results section first
8284,3_technical,4_specific,How did you judge this – be more specific.
8285,1_basic,3_general,"Like we discussed in class, you need primary literature in your intro"
8286,3_technical,1_pointer,40 or 48? Be consistent!
8287,3_technical,4_specific,"Revise this statement and focus on the part that you used Hill reaction assay, which was an important aspect from your methods section."
8288,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Very solid explanation in your intro, but you tend to repeat yourself. Try to work on eliminating redundancies and making your writing more concise."
8289,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs in the discussion.
8290,2_writing,2_copyedit,Have results or demonstrate results. Avoid using “prove” this way.
8291,3_technical,4_specific,Specify exactly which value you ran the tests on.
8292,3_technical,2_copyedit,Report means and SDs together; it’s hard to pair means and SDs when they’re separated by a sentence or two.
8293,2_writing,1_pointer,?
8294,3_technical,3_general,Don’t need to have this list.  Just explain the use of each material as you get to them.
8295,3_technical,3_general,Your graph should not have a title and you need to check the core resource guide on how to write a figure caption or look at primary literature and see what they include in theirs.
8296,3_technical,4_specific,"A t-test is not necessary to calculate the SD. The SD is a descriptor of the sample, it indicates the amount of dispersion of the set of data values."
8297,2_writing,3_general,"Please make sure this paragraph still uses complete sentences, not just a list of numbers."
8298,2_writing,3_general,You need to start more boradly
8299,3_technical,2_copyedit,[Fulton: 2001]
8300,1_basic,4_specific,"Similarly, do not try to interpret or discuss your data just yet."
8301,4_logic,6_holistic,Why does early growth limit future growth?
8302,3_technical,2_copyedit,Your legend is also cutoff
8303,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations are not correct
8304,4_logic,4_specific,"In your results section you say that the experimental group has a shorter contraction time than the control, and in the figure you switch them.  Here in the discussion you conclude there was an increase in contraction time which contradicts your data and your lab groups data."

8306,3_technical,2_copyedit,Your p value is higher than 0.05
8307,3_technical,4_specific,This is cool but is somewhat shown in the other graph so it doesn’t need to be included
8308,4_logic,3_general,What’s the difference? How does it relate to your study? You need to be more specific.
8309,3_technical,4_specific,"This is a nice table, but you should also have some kind of graph showing your results visually. Let me know if you need help on how to make one."
8310,3_technical,2_copyedit,0.08

8312,3_technical,4_specific,"This is better than the table, but where are the error bars?"
8313,3_technical,4_specific,"This is raw data and is better suited for your notebook.  You should have a paragraph that sums up your entire results:  include the averages that are most important, the statistics results, and any other observation that you bring up in your argument in the discussion."
8314,3_technical,3_general,You should not mention the null hypothesis in your lab report; it is only a statistical technique.

8318,2_writing,4_specific,"I would include this at the end of your methods section, but not here"
8319,3_technical,3_general,Your figure caption should explain what I’m supposed to get out of looking at this figure.
8320,4_logic,3_general,These are all good but they are not natural extensions of your experiment I would focus on things that would clarify your findings
8321,3_technical,4_specific,"No need to re-state this here, since it’s already in the methods section"
8322,3_technical,6_holistic,"You say the weight ratios are in grams, but do ratios have units?"
8323,3_technical,2_copyedit,Try to mention the pesticide used (Martin’s IGR)
8324,4_logic,3_general,These are not explanations of the results
8325,3_technical,4_specific,"Statistical outcome supporting the result could be included at the end of the sentence between parenthesis. Check in the annotation exercise, the format to report the results with the statistical outcome."
8326,3_technical,3_general,These figure captions need a lot of work.  Your figures as well need improvement.
8327,3_technical,2_copyedit,Those are cations channels because they can move Na+ and K+
8328,3_technical,3_general,I should be able to follow exactly what you did by reading your methods section down to the volumes and the wavelength your spec was set to…
8329,4_logic,4_specific,Make sure your explanation of R:S is consistent in your introduction; your hypothesis does not correspond to the literature that you present.
8330,3_technical,4_specific,"Your group members reported a p-value of 0.024025, which is much closer to what I would expect for this experiment. You may want to review with them how they ran the statistical test because you initially reported far too many degrees of freedom, and lowering those should have lowered your p-value. Since it didn’t, that tells me you may have run the t-test wrong."
8331,3_technical,4_specific,You didn’t measure a frog. Be more specific
8332,4_logic,4_specific,"I think this study could be a good argument for using different concentrations of ecdysone, but your explanation of “similar findings” to your experiment needs a bit of elaboration"
8333,3_technical,2_copyedit,What was the dilution of the Precor?
8334,3_technical,4_specific,Which is the figure corresponding to this caption?
8335,4_logic,4_specific,More because you saw growth toward glycine and not glucose like you predicted.
8336,2_writing,2_copyedit,Although…
8337,4_logic,2_copyedit,I would try to include 1 or 2 lines about what sodium normally does in muscle contraction.
8338,2_writing,2_copyedit,Careful. You cannot “prove” a hypothesis; you can only “support” or “reject” it.
8339,2_writing,3_general,"Again, informal"
8340,3_technical,4_specific,You could report the Mean and SD in this section also
8341,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If you have it, I would include the width as well (How long the pulse lasted)"
8342,4_logic,3_general,What? Explain what you mean and biologically what is going on.
8343,3_technical,4_specific,"As stated above, any time you graph an average, standard deviation error bars would be needed. As such, this graph would need 14 standard deviation bars total."
8344,3_technical,4_specific,Citation? Does it refer to Oregon state 2018 or a new one?
8345,2_writing,3_general,Start more broadly.
8346,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check citation format
8347,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much of this was injected into the leg?
8348,1_basic,3_general,Citations in the discussion?
8349,4_logic,4_specific,"I understand your reasoning behind this. However, the Ach already present only inhibits further release of Ach according to your paper. If the Ach hang around while the receptors are not inhibited, we would still receive contraction. (The Ach also doesn’t stick around very long)."
8350,3_technical,4_specific,In what condition did this happen?
8351,2_writing,2_copyedit,but
8352,4_logic,4_specific,"Than what? You set this up as a comparison, but didn’t offer an alternative."
8353,2_writing,3_general,"Your introduction is generally good, you explain resource allocation well. Can you streamline it more? Some places are repetitive."
8354,3_technical,4_specific,"This graph is definitely better, but this figure caption needs some work. Write what the graph is showing, main trends from the graph, number of organisms in each group, your statistical results, etc."
8355,3_technical,4_specific,You could say that although the data was not statistically significant the animals in the control group showed signs of pupation unlike the animals treated with Precor
8356,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is incorrect. If your p-value is below 0.05 your results are significant. So here you can’t reject the null hypothesis.
8357,2_writing,4_specific,This is unnecessary information. Start by introducing intraspecific aggression and its importance
8358,3_technical,3_general,Citations
8359,2_writing,2_copyedit,"You already said this, no need to repeat it."
8360,3_technical,4_specific,Not necessary in discussion. Reporting stat results would be more appropriate
8361,3_technical,2_copyedit,I think there was a problem with the error bars because they should be symmetric.
8362,3_technical,4_specific,"No, not if your p-value is 0.267"

8367,3_technical,4_specific,Missing error bars
8368,3_technical,2_copyedit,Mention the specific muscle used
8369,1_basic,3_general,Primary literature?
8370,3_technical,4_specific,"Ah, so it didn’t move directly towards the Physarum. Here it’s important to make that distinction in how you took measurements in your methods section. Did you go based on leading edge? If so, this data point would probably be inconclusive in the results section. Did you go based on a central axis upon which you took measurements? Instead, that’d be different."
8371,3_technical,2_copyedit,Only need two sig figs
8372,3_technical,3_general,This is raw data. Not needed.
8373,2_writing,3_general,"I’m kind of getting it, but not really. Think about how to word this differently."
8374,2_writing,4_specific,Your abstract doesn’t say anything about the role of  curcumin in your experimental design
8375,3_technical,2_copyedit,I believe the units should also be volts? Unless your machine had a weird setting on
8376,3_technical,4_specific,"While this technically fulfills the primary literature requirement, it would be good to have more than one primary source."
8377,4_logic,6_holistic,You could omit this and that statement is not true. An experiment is not successful because the results support the hypothesis.
8378,4_logic,3_general,"Your discussion needs to give a biological reason why your results may have occurred, don’t just attribute it to error."
8379,3_technical,2_copyedit,Azagard
8380,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Mention your sample size, what error bars represent, statistical results, etc."

8382,3_technical,8_nobasis,no
8383,3_technical,4_specific,Citation?
8384,3_technical,2_copyedit,Include means ± standard deviations for R:S ratios for each group as well. Do you have a figure or table for R:S ratios? Reference those here.
8385,3_technical,4_specific,This part needs citation
8386,2_writing,4_specific,"This is the important bit – lead with this, and then speculate about the other sources of error if you wish."
8387,4_logic,4_specific,"What’s IBMX? What do these compounds do? What effect might they have on this pathway and why? Right now, your hypothesis has little to no support."

8390,3_technical,4_specific,"Your figure/table does not actually show this as a negative, which is confusing."
8391,4_logic,6_holistic,"Hmm, you set up the end of your discussion like you had a big connection to make to ecology and evolution, and this is a pretty vague statement. Think a little more deeply about this point and include a specific connection between behavior and fitness, or something along those lines."
8392,3_technical,4_specific,A sentence about why you are using this organism would be good.
8393,3_technical,4_specific,What are these averages of? Because if it is just one value than you shouldn’t have standard deviations
8394,3_technical,4_specific,"This is the p-value for the comparison of your results, so it is a result. That should not be in this section. In the methods you only need to mention the type of statistic test that was used and you can specify the p-value used for significance. That is all."
8395,4_logic,4_specific,I really like this explanation for why you think the contraction may have decreased (The muscle was already at maximal contraction). Could you share this idea with your group members?
8396,3_technical,2_copyedit,Centrifuged
8397,3_technical,2_copyedit,Dimensions?
8398,3_technical,2_copyedit,They are +/- 1 standard deviation. Also report your stats in the figure caption

8400,4_logic,4_specific,"I don’t understand how is this study explaining your results. What is your interpretation based on what they did? If you can make the link between this study and the study of the other researchers, then it will be more clear."
8401,4_logic,6_holistic,Can you say more about that? Why do you think that is? Can you back it up with observations or photos of the plants? Have other studies found something similar?
8402,3_technical,3_general,Do not put the same data in a figure and a table
8403,3_technical,3_general,It would be wise to reference some of your figures when you are making these statements. Good job with finding a good paper and making a biological interpretation!
8404,3_technical,3_general,Reference the figuresReport mean and SD for each treatmentStatistical results
8405,2_writing,3_general,Try to avoid sentences with prepositions as it is considered informal.
8406,3_technical,2_copyedit,You can add the p-value here to help support your statement
8407,3_technical,2_copyedit,State the temperature
8408,3_technical,3_general,"You included raw data. In the future, provide a figure instead of tables."
8409,3_technical,3_general,Figures are REALLY hard to see….I don’t think I can give much feedback on them except to delete gridlines. Otherwise I think they look okay?
8410,3_technical,2_copyedit,The gastrocnemius is the muscle and is “controlled” by the sciatic nerve

8415,3_technical,2_copyedit,What we labeled the tubes is not important
8416,2_writing,3_general,Start more broadly
8417,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not the lab manual we are using.

8434,4_logic,3_general,"Interpret the results you did get before telling me all the possible errors in your study. Also, variance does not cause error – it’s real and valid data. It just so happens that the data are highly variable. So I would rephrase this."
8435,3_technical,2_copyedit,“centrifugation”
8436,2_writing,3_general,Avoid direct quotes of more than 2-3 words. You could paraphrase this pretty easily.
8437,3_technical,4_specific,What does the citation at the end of this sentence reference? Specifically discuss what the paper is talking about
8438,4_logic,4_specific,"But if this was the case, wouldn’t the control have molted? Your explanation for why they got bigger does make sense but I think we can only say that the continued JH prevented them from preparing to molt."
8439,2_writing,2_copyedit,Did you mean the timing of the molt?
8440,3_technical,2_copyedit,In all of the trials?
8441,3_technical,4_specific,Where is series 2?
8442,3_technical,4_specific,I would rather clearly indicate treatment (test compound vs. control) and report stat values with correct format rather than putting it this way
8443,3_technical,2_copyedit,How much?
8444,3_technical,4_specific,Statistics? How do you know whether or not they were significantly different?
8445,4_logic,6_holistic,You need to explain your results about phosphorous biologically. Why did you observe those growth patterns?
8446,2_writing,3_general,No quotes
8447,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Avoid the word “prove.” In sciences, there is always some uncertainty involved. Your data may always have come from a reason separate from your original hypothesis. As such, I would say “supported”"
8448,3_technical,6_holistic,Can you specify which one was greater? Just saying that it was different is not enough to understand the result.
8449,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is confusing
8450,3_technical,2_copyedit,Use a scientific name
8451,3_technical,4_specific,Need to explain/define which behaviors you measured.
8452,3_technical,4_specific,"Since you have so many figures, pick the three that best support your arguments in the discussion."
8453,3_technical,2_copyedit,At what wavelength?
8454,3_technical,3_general,"These figures are pretty confusing to look at, and I’m not sure they are all that informative. Just make a bar graph like the one I showed in class"
8455,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, you should have a legend explaining what the colors mean on the figure or at least explain them in the caption."
8456,2_writing,4_specific,Consider changing the order. For example:Sodium Channel Blocker causes an increase in the threshold of muscle contraction in Rana pipiens
8457,3_technical,2_copyedit,Don’t use a title for figures and just make sure your standard deviations are reflected by your standard error bars
8458,4_logic,3_general,"Also, explore other possibilities and provide more suggestions to improve your current model/plan"
8459,4_logic,4_specific,What was the reason that you hypothesized? Wasn’t because of the caffeine? That statement is not clear because you didn’t mention the results before.
8460,3_technical,4_specific,"Need to specify that you found the average R:S for each pot, then used those pot averages in the statistics"
8461,2_writing,4_specific,This should come before your experimental methods
8462,2_writing,2_copyedit,You can omit this
8463,3_technical,4_specific,This is interesting but shown well in the bar graph so you don’t need this graph.
8464,2_writing,4_specific,You can omit this here and explain it in the methods. You will only need to change the order of these sentences in the methods. First mention that myograms were recorded and then specify the phases and which one you measured.
8465,3_technical,4_specific,"This is for the results, not the figure legend"
8466,3_technical,2_copyedit,"If this is shown on a figure, you should reference it here. All figures included in the report should be referred to in the text, usually in the results section."
8467,4_logic,4_specific,"There’s a whole lot about why you used Physarum in your abstract and intro, but not enough biological background on the signaling cascade you’re investigating."
8468,4_logic,4_specific,Wasn’t your hypothesis about R:S
8469,3_technical,2_copyedit,Root to shoot ratio for length.
8470,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
8471,2_writing,4_specific,I would change the title and be more specific mentioning the chemical that you used.
8472,2_writing,6_holistic,"I would try to reorganize this—maybe present biological background first, then explain why you’re testing NaCl, because then you can more clearly relay what problems it may pose to the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis."
8473,4_logic,4_specific,To look for significant differences in what? You were looking for significant differences in the number of points each fish (or was it based on pairs of fish) accumulated when expose to each of the treatments.
8474,4_logic,4_specific,"Instead of thinking that three replicates were too small, think about the procedure of isolating the chloroplast. Maybe there weren’t enough chloroplast in the samples because they weren’t isolated properly. You mentioned about it in later sentences. Three replicates is a standard sample size so I wouldn’t say that it is too small."
8475,2_writing,4_specific,"Make sure this seems relevant from the start, a lot of this seems like it doesn’t apply to manduca sexta so start out by summarizing how their experiment was similar."
8476,2_writing,3_general,Start broader
8477,2_writing,3_general,Methods should be in past tense
8478,3_technical,4_specific,A separate chart for standard deviation is not needed as you have it already as a bar on your graphs.
8479,3_technical,4_specific,Units on the y-axis and make sure the y axis doesn’t extend past 0.
8480,4_logic,6_holistic,"Also, what does this mean for agriculture? You mentioned it in the introduction, so you should mention it again the discussion."
8481,2_writing,3_general,"You have 200 words for the abstract, try to use them. Check your primary literature for what they put into an abstract"
8482,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviation?
8483,3_technical,4_specific,"Use standard error, not standard deviation. Standard error is standard deviation divided by the square root of sample size."
8484,3_technical,4_specific,"You gave them a brand of insecticide called Precor which contained methoprene which is a JH analogue, they’re not all the same thing"
8485,3_technical,4_specific,How many muscles are included in the analysis? You can specify that and the studied species in the figure caption
8486,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would also include the width used as well (duration of the pulse)
8487,3_technical,2_copyedit,"I would say Martin’s IGR or insect growth, but ecdysone was not one of the key points of our experiment."
8488,2_writing,3_general,"Try to trim the methods a little, it can get a bit redundant and has some extraneous information"

8490,3_technical,2_copyedit,"[Johnson, 2018]"
8491,2_writing,6_holistic,I may choose to leave this part out as JH in insects is well studied.
8492,3_technical,4_specific,Why would this change relative growth of roots? Didn’t both treatments receive the same amount of sunlight?
8493,3_technical,3_general,put the formula for this somewhere
8494,2_writing,3_general,Revise
8495,3_technical,4_specific,What is normal food?Specify the amount of drops per grams of food. That information shouldn’t be between parenthesis because that is the most important information of the sentence.
8496,3_technical,4_specific,"What was the manipulated hormone? Be precise, especially if that is your hypothesis"
8497,2_writing,1_pointer,?
8498,3_technical,2_copyedit,Don’t need titles in the figures
8499,1_basic,3_general,You need citations in your introduction. This is a violation of the basic criteria and is an automatic failing grade. You also never explain the concept of aggression.
8500,3_technical,4_specific,Also introduce statistical tests you performed to analyze the data
8501,3_technical,4_specific,"So the error bars here are definitely not correct, as they should be centered on each of the bars"
8502,3_technical,4_specific,"You do not need to put this stuff in a table.  If you had 10 averages and 5 p-values then yeah, but you don’t so this table can and should be summed up in two sentences."
8503,2_writing,4_specific,"Again, save this for the methods."
8504,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is redundant
8505,3_technical,2_copyedit,I wouldn’t use this word; it has an evolutionary connotation.
8506,2_writing,3_general,Try not to end on a citation. This is easily fixed by simply rearranging the sentence.

8521,3_technical,4_specific,"Use standard error, not standard deviation. Standard error is standard deviation divided by the square root of sample size"
8522,2_writing,3_general,"Intro! I didn’t know what you were talking about reading your report, lol!"
8523,2_writing,2_copyedit,You don’t need to state the null hypothesis anywhere

8530,3_technical,2_copyedit,"For all values, make sure you don’t use too many digits. This goes for stats as well."
8531,3_technical,4_specific,"So you shouldn’t do a t-test for each leg, as it’s over a series of input voltages and doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to do. You can pick a stimulus voltage and take contraction amplitude averages, and then do a test on that"
8532,3_technical,4_specific,Can you specify the result? What is your data? Just mention exactly what did you find about the threshold before and after injection.
8533,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you run?

8539,2_writing,4_specific,This belongs in the results section
8540,3_technical,3_general,No need to list materials separately. You can just mention them as you use them in the procedure.
8541,3_technical,4_specific,Your figures still need units on the axes. Were these in volts? Amps? Something else?
8542,2_writing,4_specific,This should be in your discussion section. The results section should just state your statistical results and whether they are significant or not. It should not mention your hypothesis

8548,2_writing,4_specific,Just state your actual hypothesis
8549,3_technical,4_specific,"IMPORTANT: your null hypothesis is that varying salt concentration would not significantly affect the photosynthesis, which you found in your experiment. So, you accept the null hypothesis. Your alternative hypothesis is that varying salt concentration would have significant effect on photosynthesis.

8570,2_writing,3_general,Formalize the language a bit here. This works for a lab notebook but here you should pretend like you are writing a scientific paper.
8571,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this recipe style of writing methods section because that’s not how it is used in a scientific literature. Check primary literature on similar experiments to see how they wrote their methods section and revise.
8572,3_technical,2_copyedit,When was this source published?
8573,3_technical,2_copyedit,And because you have a caption your figure does not need a title
8574,4_logic,4_specific,This wouldn’t necessarily affect your results so much as increase chances that your culture was contaminated.
8575,4_logic,6_holistic,Why would this cause fatigue and not tetany?
8576,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way)."
8577,3_technical,4_specific,Are your error bars fitted to each data point?
8578,3_technical,4_specific,"I laughed out loud when I scrolled down to your picture. The emailed figure was fine, but is really raw data. I want you to calculate the average aggression of each experimental treatment and display error bars for the standard deviation."
8579,3_technical,3_general,Missing citations

8586,2_writing,4_specific,"Need some background on how bettas (or fish in general) react to foreign objects that they encounter, either in tanks or in the wild, to give some context for your experiment. This kind of comes out of nowhere."

8600,2_writing,1_pointer,…what?
8601,2_writing,2_copyedit,This is awkwardly worded
8602,1_basic,3_general,"The biggest problem was the organizational issue - which is one of  “basic criteria” from our grading rubric.

Don’t panic, we’ll fix this."

8612,1_basic,3_general,Your introduction needs to have primary literature citations
8613,2_writing,4_specific,This intro would benefit from a bit more info on the M. sexta and why you are using it as your model organism.
8614,2_writing,3_general,We make conclusion at the end of discussion not when describing results.

8629,3_technical,4_specific,"What did you measure? How many replicates? What type of t-test, specifically?"

8660,2_writing,4_specific,You Abstract should have indicated highlights of future implications of your current experiment at a broader scale.
8661,3_technical,4_specific,I would probably say this was likely due to the high variability in your experimental measurements (note the huge error bar for treatment when compared to the one for control). This would be alleviated with a larger sample size as you mentioned.
8662,3_technical,4_specific,Mention that this is the calcium channel blocker

8804,4_logic,3_general,Nice using primary literature but make sure it is obvious what the connection between it and your experiment is
8805,3_technical,3_general,You can incorporate the statistical outcome at the end of the sentence describing the averaged mass for each group. Statistics will determine if those difference were by chance or not. It is unnecessary to write a whole sentence just for the statistical outcome. Check in the annotation exercise how to report statistics in the results.

8807,3_technical,3_general,"This is all raw data. There is nothing wrong with recording their coloration and presenting that, but listing all of this information when you only reference one part of it renders it raw data which only belongs in your notebook."
8808,3_technical,4_specific,Can you elaborate more the figure legend? Remember that the captions should be self-explanatory. What is the treatment? Is this the total change in mass after eight days of treatment?
8809,3_technical,4_specific,You can include the outcome from statistical analysis with the corresponding result. Avoid using separate sentences just for the statistical analysis.

8848,3_technical,4_specific,Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.

8865,3_technical,4_specific,This is unnecessary. You don’t include the table with the data used for the statistical analysis in the lab reportThe statistical analysis is not quite right. You included in both groups the weight of your four individuals for the eight days of the experiment. How can you analyze the growth in each group if you included the weights from every single day? To analyze how the animal is growing you need to see the change in weight between days. That’s the only way of knowing if an animal is growing. Look for the difference in weight between the final and the first day of experimentation.

As such, this graph should have 16 standard deviation bars total."
8890,4_logic,3_general,How specifically does resource limitation effect allocation patterns? You need to connect the dots for your reader.

9127,3_technical,2_copyedit,What concentration? This is important!

9166,4_logic,4_specific,"Instead of thinking that three replicates were too small, think about the procedure of isolating the chloroplast. Maybe there weren’t enough chloroplast in the samples because they weren’t isolated properly. You mentioned about it in later sentences. Three replicates is a standard sample size so I wouldn’t say that it is too small."

9184,3_technical,4_specific,Another potential reason could be error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves. Recall that you didn’t actually record the relative density of chloroplast this time. Going through that step to ensure your sample actually had a high density of chloroplast would be an effective way to ensuring that you had chloroplast in your treatment to begin with.

9211,3_technical,2_copyedit,Did you stimulate the muscle or the nerve?
9212,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Placed in the path of the Physarum, we wanted to test whether filter paper soaked in trifluoroperazine would reduce distance traveled of the Physarum towards glucose…"
9213,3_technical,4_specific,"Also, the graph does not need a title, but should have a better legend. Have the box say “individual number”"
9214,3_technical,3_general,"Choose the correct format for your cited literature. It could be MLA, APA, etc."
9215,3_technical,2_copyedit,Do not use a table to report only the statistical outcome.
9216,3_technical,4_specific,"I’m a little confused here. The p-values should represent a comparison. So, low CO2 to what? You should have a reference to your figure here, as well as means +/- SDs. Please let me know if you need any help."
9217,3_technical,4_specific,"There should be some numbers in this figure caption, averages, standard devs, stats; less methods"
9218,3_technical,2_copyedit,I would leave this as “Martin’s IGR” as you explain the dilution later on in the methods
9219,3_technical,2_copyedit,Threshold was measured in V
9220,2_writing,3_general,Avoid this “recipe” style
9221,2_writing,4_specific,move to method
9222,2_writing,8_nobasis,In place of?
9223,2_writing,4_specific,Save these details for the methods
9224,4_logic,6_holistic,"Okay great, restate your findings to orient the reader and make the rest of your discussion flow much better. You don’t need to include the next few sentences (crossed out here), as you already said those things in the methods. You spend a lot of time discussing the Shulman study, and it’s a good one to support your findings, but do a bit more interpretation of your own data. Why might the fish be using the shelter and avoiding aggressive conflict, what benefits does that bring to the fish? Think about it in terms of fitness and evolution."
9225,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Good, you should use the authors’ last names instead of the name of the journal if you want to do a citation like this."
9226,3_technical,4_specific,No need to include the concentration in the intro (save it for the methods)
9227,2_writing,3_general,You can make this title more concise
9228,3_technical,4_specific,"Why paired? If you need help with this, please let me know!"
9229,3_technical,3_general,Cite your figures
9230,2_writing,3_general,"This was a solid intro, but you need to be more specific."
9231,3_technical,3_general,Where are the figure legends?
9232,2_writing,4_specific,The flow of these sentences is a little off – consider deleting or moving the first sentence and restructuring the rest so there is better continuity
9233,1_basic,3_general,"The critical mistake here is the lack of peer-reviewed primary resources. Citing the lab manual is ok, but you have to have other references too. See me if you have questions about this"
9234,2_writing,2_copyedit,I would start the discussion with this and have it in the form of “It wasn’t significant but we noted that….”
9235,4_logic,3_general,"Well we always knew that, nature does have a way of working, so what did this experiment mean? What was its significance."
9236,2_writing,3_general,Revise
9237,2_writing,4_specific,"Highlight from this segment should reflect in Abstract. Since your entire Abstract didn’t come through, I can’t tell if you have done it or not."
9238,4_logic,4_specific,"You hinted at sodium’s role in actin filament formation in your abstract; I want to see something more concreate like that in your intro too, with more depth, to support your hypothesis. Or, you could go with how Physarum uses diffusion to move and search its environment. You established that sodium is crucial, but make that tie to movement explicit."
9239,2_writing,4_specific,"Include a topic sentence at the beginning of this paragraph, something like, “Mung bean plants were planted and grown in sunlight and shade for two weeks.” Then you can talk about the details. This type of sentence will orient the reader to where you are heading with the paragraph.How did you exclude the sunlight? This can be more specific"
9240,4_logic,4_specific,"Clearly state your hypothesis. If you treat your spinach and chard leaves with laundry detergent, you expect an increased or decreased rate of photosynthesis. Keep you hypothesis as straight-forward as possible. “If laundry detergent reduces photosynthetic activity” means that your hypothesis does not clearly indicate how laundry detergent would affect photosynthesis activity."
9241,4_logic,6_holistic,What are the costs and benefits of this behavior?
9242,4_logic,3_general,This discussion would benefit from more references to other findings in the primary literature.
9243,2_writing,2_copyedit,Of the root to the shoot
9244,4_logic,4_specific,How is this pertinent to R:S in differing substrates?
9245,3_technical,4_specific,"Can you explain the coloration of the bars – what is represented by red, what is green? What do the error bars show?"
9246,3_technical,2_copyedit,"Even though this was what you intended to do originally, this is not the dilution and treatment level you actually used.  What was the dilution of the Precor you used?"
9247,2_writing,3_general,Passive voice is recommended
9248,2_writing,2_copyedit,Doesn’t need to be explicitly said. It is understood
9249,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you put colons : between the author’s name and the year
9250,4_logic,4_specific,Why did you suggest this? Did they show signs of pupation?
9251,3_technical,4_specific,"You have your inference about the stats backwards. When p &gt; 0.05, this means that your difference just happened by chance (no effect of your treatment). When p&lt;0.05, this means that there was a signficiant effect of your treatment."
9252,4_logic,4_specific,"These are probably applications of your study, or the relevance of conducting studies like that one. Emphasize that in the text."
9253,2_writing,2_copyedit,"Don’t make your title a question, briefly tell me how JH affects growth of caterpillars. Also, spell out Juvenile Hormone here"
9254,3_technical,2_copyedit,What frog? What muscle?
9255,3_technical,4_specific,The blocker is inhibiting the process of removing Ach form the synapse
9256,2_writing,2_copyedit,remove
9257,4_logic,3_general,No need to discuss sources of error unless you have evidence that it actually affected your results
9258,3_technical,3_general,This is not how a t-test works
9259,3_technical,4_specific,The error bars were improperly formatted.
9260,3_technical,2_copyedit,When you take the screenshot try to not hover over it because that Chart Area is blocking the legend. Try to clean up this graph a little bit also.
9261,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations should accompany averages
9262,2_writing,3_general,No need for this part
9263,2_writing,4_specific,"This is part of the discussion, no results"
9264,4_logic,6_holistic,"We believe this is because…. (here you present this as a fact, and I can think of other cues that were also missing when you presented the fish with the fakes). Can you also think of them? Including those may allow you to make an even more convincing argument."
9265,1_basic,3_general,Missing outside sources (Basic Criteria)
9266,3_technical,8_nobasis,Figure 1 is your reagent table
9267,3_technical,4_specific,This isn’t necessary as it just explains what error bars show. The exact value for standard deviation wasn’t important within your study and therefore can be left as just an error bar.
9268,3_technical,2_copyedit,There were not control and experimental groups. The same muscle was analyzed n both conditions.
9269,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way)."
9270,3_technical,2_copyedit,2% water agar
9271,3_technical,4_specific,somewhat subjective.. (wording of results)
9272,2_writing,8_nobasis,Rewrite this. It is just repeating the previous sentence bu just saying it was not ocnsistent
9273,3_technical,2_copyedit,So you need the concentration and the amount you injected. 0.1 ml of 1 mM lanthanum chloride
9274,2_writing,4_specific,Revise this statement to make more formal
9275,2_writing,1_pointer,Reread this sentence
9276,2_writing,3_general,Avoid expressions like this one
9277,3_technical,4_specific,(Un)paired? Tails?
9278,2_writing,3_general,Very thorough title! Could possibly make it a bit more concise…
9279,3_technical,4_specific,Make it clear that each frog was its own control. This makes it sound like you used different frogs for the two treatements
9280,2_writing,4_specific,"If you’re going to talk about enzymes later in the pathway, explain what they are and why they’re relevant."
9281,2_writing,4_specific,You need to start more broadly. What are the underlying biological concepts
9282,2_writing,2_copyedit,Word choice. “display” perhaps?
9283,2_writing,4_specific,"Try to use a more scientific tone throughout your lab report. For example, water solubility decreases in warmer waters is a more formal and scientific way to express this fact."
9284,3_technical,4_specific,"Your figures are at the bottom but Im going to address them here.  You should remove the table, it is summed up sufficiently in your bar graph. Each figure (graph) needs a stronger caption. What goes in these captions are explained in the Bio Res. Guide however remember to include the statistics and the standard deviation values in the figure caption of your Figure 2.  Only the stats would go in the fig 1 caption.  The figures should not have titles."
9285,3_technical,4_specific,What statistical test did you use to analyze your data?
9286,3_technical,2_copyedit,Revise. Or just state that Paraquat would lower photosynthesis activity.
9287,3_technical,4_specific,"Same leg was the control and received the treatmen, so write this according to that"
9288,3_technical,2_copyedit,2% water agar
9289,4_logic,6_holistic,Why is it important? Why might it be particularly important to understand this in a crop plant like buckwheat?
9290,3_technical,2_copyedit,Check the citation format
9291,2_writing,4_specific,Can you be more specific? Gastrocnemius muscle
9292,2_writing,4_specific,"Also, avoid “incorrect/correct” when talking about hypotheses, and only use “data do/don’t support the hypothesis”"
9293,4_logic,4_specific,"In addition, I don’t think the leg no longer contracting is an error. Based on your expected function of tubocurarine, it’s expected that it would decrease muscle contraction or completely stop it as acetylcholine can no longer bind to its receptors."
9294,3_technical,4_specific,"Although you said their names right below this, you would still have to cite it as (Olorunshura, 2011)"
9295,3_technical,4_specific,"What is this? Is a hormone, a growth regulator, a toxic chemical? How is that related to your experiment or support your results?"
9296,3_technical,4_specific,All three amongst each other or the three treatments against the control?
9297,4_logic,2_copyedit,Consider ending with a broader statement about why this type of research is important.
9298,4_logic,4_specific,I wouldn’t say it was a failure just because you didn’t get a conclusive result. You should look up leaky calcium channels in the literature. They are a possible explanation cited by several other students in our lab.
9299,3_technical,2_copyedit,Missing the journal number and pages
9300,3_technical,3_general,"Within the introduction, cite all pertinent literature using the [Last name of first author: year] citation format."
9301,3_technical,8_nobasis,Visit the link on the last page of this document for necessary improvementNo analysis was done.
9302,1_basic,3_general,Hypothesis missing (basic criteria)
9303,4_logic,3_general,You took out some really good stuff that would support this hypothesis.
9304,2_writing,4_specific,"This is neither a very convincing explanation of your results nor a conclusion, so don’t include this in the Abstract"
9305,2_writing,3_general,"Overall you need to work on writing quality and more detail. This is the bare minimum of what should be included in a lab report, but there needs to be more for full credit"
9306,3_technical,3_general,Raw data
9307,4_logic,6_holistic,Why would you get a change in weight with the azamax? How is Ecdysterone related to weight?
9308,3_technical,4_specific,"This will be more obvious if you change the x-axis. In that case, you don’t need to specify which bar corresponds with each leg."
9309,3_technical,2_copyedit,Make sure you mention your alpha
9310,3_technical,2_copyedit,Alpha value of 0.05
9311,1_basic,3_general,Missing an outside source (Basic Criteria)
9312,4_logic,4_specific,This seemed strange so I took a look at your article. Lidocaine could ultimately affect calcium release (due to the role sodium plays in muscle contraction) but it shouldn’t have any effect on creation of calcium ions.
9313,3_technical,4_specific,"You don’t need to go this indepth in the figure caption, summarize the results more than the methods"
9314,3_technical,4_specific,"As you’re more interested in the total difference in mass rather than the change for each day, you could use a bar graph showing the difference between final/initial mass (Your current graph works too but, you will want to quantify the difference in growth in some way)."
9315,3_technical,2_copyedit,It should’ve been a paired t-test
9316,3_technical,3_general,"Generally, you report averages of each group, and then state +/- the standard deviation"
9317,3_technical,2_copyedit,There isn’t a figure 4
9318,3_technical,4_specific,Did you weight the containers? Is that relevant?
9319,4_logic,3_general,"You provided a lot of really good info, but I feel like I’m going back and forth reading some of it. Try to make more clear the info leading up to your hypothesis."
9320,3_technical,3_general,Citations are necessary in this section
9321,3_technical,3_general,"Make sure to include an actual description of any figures. Only tables (Should be labeled as “table 1, table 2 separately from figures) do not need descriptions."
9322,3_technical,4_specific,"or maybe it already did in the beginning and then changed its direction, you can examine past directions by examining the traces they leave behind against a light source"
9323,3_technical,4_specific,Here you could include a sentence to make sure the reader notices the specific caterpillars you call outliers
9324,2_writing,1_pointer,?
9325,3_technical,2_copyedit,Standard deviations
9326,3_technical,4_specific,You need at least one sentence in here about how you actually tested this.
9327,3_technical,2_copyedit,Put units on these values
9328,3_technical,2_copyedit,This is not the lab manual we are using.
9329,3_technical,2_copyedit,Missing information about the statistical analysis. You should include here the used test.
9330,3_technical,4_specific,Why? (Rationale on statistics)
9331,1_basic,2_copyedit,This would be considered Raw data (Basic Criteria)
9332,3_technical,4_specific,hemocytometer is actually the essential part.
9333,2_writing,3_general,"You already did this experiment, so past-passive!"
9334,2_writing,4_specific,"This is something that should be discussed in the discussion, not the reuslts"
9335,2_writing,2_copyedit,you can omit this
9336,2_writing,4_specific,You can save this for the results section
9337,2_writing,3_general,Colloquial
9338,3_technical,4_specific,This is part of the results. That is the result of your first day of measurements.
9339,2_writing,3_general,Start more broadly
