Title: Interspecific and Intraspecific behavior patterns in male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important topic in conservation biology. With changing climates it is important to understand how plants will alter their allocation patterns in response to environmental variables. Here we look at the effect of sand on the growth patterns of the root and shoot tissues of Fagopyrum esculentum. The expectation was that the root to shoot length and weight ratios would be much greater in plants grown in the porous sand compared to plants grown in vermiculite in order to compensate for the quick rate of percolation. Our data showed no significant difference in length root to shoot ratio but did show a significant difference in weight root to shoot ratio. This significance, in conjunction with our observation of more roots per plant grown in sand or a sand/vermiculite mix, suggests that in response to a porous soil F. esculentum grows more roots in an attempt to harvest more nutrients from the porous soil. This adaptation shows a beneficial change in resource allocation that allows F. esculentum to best thrive in a changing environment.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of hormones on insect development. Hormones are important chemical components in both insects and mammals that stimulate specific cells or tissues. In humans, hormones play a necessary role in development that is marked by puberty. Puberty marks a human’s physical and chemical transition into adulthood similarly to how molting marks a transition into an adult in insects. Molting is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle and the old layer of skin is shed [Johnson: 2018]. This allows the insect to change size and morphology. Molting allows insects to progress from the larva to pupa and adults stages. This is noted in the holometabolous cycle which is demonstrated by the Manduca sexta, the insect of interest in this experiment [Johnson: 8]. These caterpillars are used as the model organism in this experiment because their hormone regulation has been studied extensively and it is simple to manipulate their hormone levels. Hormone activity regulation was first observed with the linden bug as published by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry. These bugs had low egg hatch rates and didn’t mature into adults. It was discovered that the paper towels used in jars with the bugs contained juvabione, which is an insect growth regulator (IGR) compound [Tunaz: 2004]. This led to more research regarding IGR’s. In the Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are two important hormones involved in development [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta have four stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. These stages are regulated by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. This experiment treats the caterpillars with an increased amount of juvenile hormone and evaluates their weight and appearance as a reflection of their development. Similarly to IGR’s, if there are increases or decreases in hormone levels, they should affect the normal development of the insects. Increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent or delay the caterpillars from becoming pupae.

Materials and Methods:
Cultivation of Oat plants  5 Rodeo oat seedlings were planted in 4 pots of vermiculite. 2 pots were placed in a greenhouse in an area under constant exposure to natural light. Another 2 pots were placed in the same greenhouse in an area under a shade cloth to simulate limited exposure to natural light. The plants were watered daily for 2 weeks.   Plant Harvesting and Measurement The plants were harvested after 2 weeks, separated from the vermiculite, washed and dried off. 3 individual Oats were collected from each pot for a total of 12 measurements. Each whole plant was weighed using a standard lab balance. The root was separated from the shoot at the seedling. The seed was included as a part of the root. The weights and lengths of each root and shoot was recorded.  Statistical Analyses  A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine differences in the average root:shoot ratios, lengths and weights of the plants grown under constant exposure to light compared to the plants grown under limited exposure to light.

Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of control plants was 0.44 and the mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.4375 (Fig.1). The mean root:shoot ratio for length in the control plants was 0.72 and the mean root:shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 0.7525 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for mass in the control plants was 0.0447 and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.0286 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for length in control plants was 0.0908 and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.1264 (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the length control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the length experimental group (t-stat = 0.3617, df = 26, P = 0.7299). The mean of the weight control group was also not statistically significantly different than that of the weight experimental group (t-stat = 0.8119, df= 6, P = 0.4479). When observing the plants on the final day, there was not much visible difference. They appeared to be around the same height. Also, the leaves of both the experimental and the control plants had the same luminosity and green color. As a result of this experiment, both the control and experimental plants had around the same length and weight (Fig.1). Overall, the control and the experimental plants had the same pattern of growth

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that fish in a reduced visibility blue environment would exhibit less aggression than when in a clear environment, was not supported. We observed no significant difference at the .05 level, suggesting that the presence of dye in the environment does not effect aggression in Beta splendens. It is possible that the dye had no effect on the vision of the fish, thus failing to inhibit their ability to identify and interact with other fish. Additionally, past investigations have found color to be a less significant visual cue as fin vibrations and size [Johnson: 1973]. This could suggest that the fish were still able to identify opposing individuals as conspecific males from their shape, behavioral patterns, and fin movements, and thus exhibited normal levels of aggression. Understanding the beta fish’s visual capabilities in the context of environmental variation and the relatedness of vision and behavior could further our understanding of the adaptive functionalities and evolutionary success of eyesight in certain fish.
